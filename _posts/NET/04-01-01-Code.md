Pattern language


Creational patterns
- how object are created
  - singleton - once created at time
  - prototype/clone - alternative to  inheritance - share functionality (like in js)
  - builder - step by step method chaining
  - factory - use fn or method instead of repeating
  - fa√ßade - api for complex system (simplify wrapper)
  - proxy - substitute

Structural patterns
- How object relates to each others


Behavioral pattern
- how object communicate with each other
   - iterator - traverse (loops) pull -based
   - observer - push based - subscribe to event. one to many
   - mediator - many-to-many -
   - state - / switch or conditional - dont scale well - finite state machine


##### SOLID Design Principles
   Single Responsibility Principle
   Open-Closed Principle
   Liskov Substitution Principle
   Interface Segregation Principle
   Dependency Inversion Principle


monad - operations on values in chain





creational
structural
behavioral

singleton pattern
- restrict instantiation to single instance

observer
- responde to what is happening
1. cache sound
2. register event
3. call event

command pattern
- async
1. comand mannagement
2. queque
3. current command
4. listen adn update

component


flywheel
- reuse data


state
- state machine
