- Perfect settings for the pop, soul, and fusion music of the 70s.  You may like to raise the `DRIVE` setting to increase the distortion, to move the `phaser’s DEPTH` setting to a relatively high level between 6 and
7, or to turn on the `tremolo` and move each of the DEPTH and RATE settings to around 5.


###### RdII
piano voice from the late 1970s. Compared with the Rdl, it has a characteristically bright, high-fidelity sound.
- the `chorus` or `phaser` effect and was primarily used in the pop ballads and fusion music of the 80s.

   - `TIME` to roughly 1.5.


###### Clv
Sets the voice of a struck-string electric keyboard from 1970s. used in the funk and
rock music of the 70s  Its electric guitarlike sound is highly distinctive.
Often combined with:
- `wah` effect

- It could also sound good to switch from wah to `tremolo` and apply a little `reverb`


###### Toy
Sets the voice of a vintage toy piano
from the 1970s. This setting combines a
bright, undulating tone with the distinctive noisy keyboard of toy pianos.

child’s toy, this type of instrument has

The CP80 was notable for a fast attack similar to that produced by using compression, and also for its unique harmonic overtones.
It works very well with a
- `chorus` effect and was used  / The chorus setting is quite light.
- If necessary, you could add presence in the high-frequency band by raising the `DRIVE` setting to around 5.
- In addition, it might sound good to turn on `D.DELAY` and set both` DEPTH` and `TIME` to 1.5.   


###### Classical Piano


# Knobes

###### Tremolo
Modulates the volume in a cyclical fashion.
When [TYPE] is set to `Rdl`, `Rdll`, or `CP`
- The sound will be cyclically panned left and right in stereo.
When [TYPE] is set to `Wr`,`Clv,` or `Toy`:
- The volume will be cyclically varied up and down

###### Wah
Modulates the filter cutoff frequency based on the input volume.
This produces a cyclical change in tone

y-2. [DEPTH] knob
Increases the effect on the sound when turned
clockwise.
 With tremolo
When [TYPE] is set to Rdl, Rdll, or
CP:
Adjusts the degree to which the sound is
modulated left and right.
When [TYPE] is set to Wr, Clv, or
Toy:
Adjusts the degree to which the volume is
modulated.

y-3. [RATE] knob
Increases the effect on the sound when turned
clockwise.
 With tremolo
Adjusts the speed of modulation.
 With wah
Adjusts the resonance offset value. This
changes the character of the modulated
sound.

# Power

`Amps` - electrons to cassy electricity (water)  =  how much electric charge pass point in one sec. - current (in `A` amps)
`Voltage` - electrical pressuere current need energy to move . Flow from - to + = from power company = 220 eu 120 us

`I` (amps) x `V` (volts) = `W` (watt) how much ennergy per time - power
kWh - how much energy used in 1h

- Lower voltage than necessary = your device won't turn on because it lacks power
- Higher voltage than necessary = your device won't turn on ever again.
- Lower amperage than necessary = your device won't turn on because it lacks power
- Higher amperage than necessary = no problem, the device will only draw what it needs.


Watt hour - energy  = 100 W lightbulb during 1 h
