WHAT TO DO WHEN A POSE T POSE ????





# [Kine FX](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/character/kinefx/index.html)   

Worlds space: input world transform into SOPs is ground truth, local space are calculated per operation. Thanks for that is easy to work with other inputs.


[CFX](/cfx/), [Unreal Animation](/uanimation/), [Animation](/animation/)   
[SOP_KineFX.hiplc](/src/hip/SOP_KineFx.hiplc)  

## Nomenclature

- **Geometry**
  - `s@name` on prim   
  - `@boneCapture` on point   
- **Joint** - Point that is part of hierarchy (defined by hierarchy). In world space
  - `s@name` unique per point + As topology change rest of points stays where supposed to  
  - `3@transform` (9flt - matrix) - (matrix3) translation, rotation, scale ( `joints orientation` )
  - `4@rest_transform` - (16flt - matrix) - add 4x4 **[ Rig Stash Pose ]** > `@rest_transform`
- **Controls**
  - `@name` on prims  


# [Create Skeletons](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/character/kinefx/skeletons.html#creatingskels)


<img src="/src/kfx/createskeleton.png" width="350">  

1. Mesh
2. Bind Pose
3. Animation


- Start root > child
- Rotation order, `Rz` `Ry` `Rx` depend on skeleton and its joint rotation
 1. one with bone (lookat from parent to child),
 2. component represent twist toward twist.  



## Create Skeleton From Geometry


### From points
Hierarchy is determined by vertex order. - However, point ordering is not considered when traversing the hierarchy.
- [ Add ].  to merg points to poly lines
- [ Parent Joints ]. To create continuous hierarchy. (select joint, and parent)

### From spline


Skeleton from `Poly line` or `L-system`
```
- **[ Orient Along Curve ]** - check: 3x3 transform, check: next edge for tangent and turn off N and tangentu.
```
- [ Rig Doctor ] / [ Skeleton ]



#### [ Rig doctor ]
- Create missing `@name`  
- Debug hierarchy
- Check [x] to initialize `@transforms`


## Create Skeleton Draw Tool

#### [ Skeleton ]
Modify and Create ~skelet. Can control bone placement, rename bones, orient selected bones, a lot of shortcuts ( `RMB` menu, `P` - details of joints). It create `@localtransform`.  (with correct orientation)

- placement type can be, can place in middle of geo or on top


## Add to Skeleton
- in separated skeleton and capture

#### [ Skeleton Mirror ]

## Skeleton Operations


#### [ Orient along curve ]
Create transform (3x3 transform), and tangent method to next edge  

#### [ Orient Joints ]
Orientation mater only for hand drawn Houdini rigs
To fix orientation. Re-orient joints with direction picking.


#### [ Delete Joints ]
- reparent after delete


#### [ Configure Joints ]
Create dictionary attribute `@fbik_jointconfig` on points.  witch:
  - `rest xform` Local ! (rest transform attribute is recomputed),
  - rot low `limits` in radians, (limits - shown as orange rect )
  - and `rot order`

Modes:  
- `Full Body IK` - most complex - local center of mass, ... rotation weights/limits
  but albo other attrib like for
- `Ragdoll`  - only rotation constraints limits  
- `Rig Pose`  - rotation and translation limits

Shortcuts:    
`Shift` + `7`/ `8` - to configure limit.  
`Shift` + `F` - to flip handle   


#### [ Skeleton Blend ]
 Blend skeletons / anims
 feed with 2 animations

# [Retarget](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/character/kinefx/retargeting.html)

<img src="/src/kfx/retarget.png" width="350">    

Retarget   
1. [ Rig Match Pose ] -   lineup pose in viewport  (Align target skeleton 2op is master )  
2. [ Map Points ] - 2 . match points

Crack IK transfers & rotates:    
3. [ Full Body IK ]  -  final retargeting    
4. [ FK Transfer ] -  
5. [ Skeleton Blend ] - i.e. fullbodyik/fktransfer


# Constraints

TU PRZERZUCIC IK Z DOŁU

# Repair
[ **realistic shoulder** ] -        
[ **reverse foot** ] -   
[ **stabilize joints** ] -   select joints to stabilize, will identify automaticly - not solve. > Delete SOP to get only joints to stablize   > use : full body ik


# Motion


## Motion Clips
Geometry place in space.   
**[ Motion Clip ]** . Not time dependent (see all frames at once). One packed primitive per frame with `@time` attrribute. To operate on neighbour frames.     
**[ Motion Clip Evaluate ]** -  Time dependent Animation - One pose per frame.  

- [ Configure Clip Info ]  
- [ Motion Clip Extract ]   - Extract Frames
- [ Motion clip retime ]   --
- ...

### Mix Animations

- [ Motion Clip Blend ]  - kitbash 2 files. 1 as base second for mix. Can delete some bones and apply partial animation.
- [ Motion Clip Cycle ]
- [ Motion Clip Sequence ] - blend (Mode: different match transition), blend frames

# Animation

## Key Animation

**[ Rig Pose ]**  - initial frame or per frame anim
-  rotation limits of your joints in the

Shortcuts  
- `Q`, `A`, `Z`, `Z`+`Shift` - cycle throu joints.     
- Motion Path `LMB` - Add `MMB` - move timeline

## Mocap

### Root motion
**[ Extract Locomotion ]** -  extract root motion   

### Optimize
- `motion clip extract key poses` - optimize mocap




## Secondary motion
1. [ Rig Statch Pose ]
2. **[ Secondary Motion ]** - to convert to clips
  - source joint group as root It need to be animated. (have delta in local transform)
  - `secondary motion` - jiggle / spring / lag/overshoot
3.  [ Evaluate Motion Clip ]



## Simulation Ragdoll
Bullet and scale must be accurate

1. [ Rig Stash Pose ]
2. [ Configure Joints ]  - Mode: Ragdoll
3. **[ Ragdoll Collision Shape ]**
   - Setup spheres [in construction of colliision shape can use custom but `name` on prims  is required, and collision should be packed]
   - Aan add properties like: mass
4.  **[ Ragdoll Constraints ]**
  - Internal Constraint: op1: ceeate cone (limit) constraints on collision spheres. (soft and hard constr.) (can use additional outside go (3op)) That will hold collisions toghether
  - External Constraint op2: constraint joint to geometry group  (glue, hard (pin and stuck), soft)
  - if no group will take closest ??
5. **[ Ragdoll Solver ]**
  - type:
   - RDB Impact Data ()






## Simulation Vellum

# [Controls](www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/character/kinefx/controlshapes.html)
Build the animation rig.
`Attach Geometry ot Joints`


Rotation order !!!! components:  1  is lookat , 2 is (twist), 3 axis

### IK


- [ **IK Chain** ] SOP. op1: skeleton. op2 control points with same name  (reparent sop with *)
 - select  root mid and tip bones points.
 - set! match by name or names for controllers
- manipulate pose before 2 op of ik chain

<img src="/src/kine/ik1.png" width="150">   

##### IK in VOPs
- can set up different behaviour of solver
- 2 bone IK

- `Solve IK`
- `Two Bone IK`

### Full body IK
to 2op:
- create controllers by deleting parts of skeleton
- [Deleet joints]
- [ **Parent joints** ] SOP with *
- rig pose

[Fullbody IK]
- match by attribute ! (name)
- can pin root
- can comupte weigth

### FK Transfer
[doc](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/kinefx--fktransfer.html)



##### Solve Curve - Spline IK  VOP
Solve curve with normalized bone lengths

RIG VOP:
take all points from in and out and drive one another.
- `get point transforms` VOP - from first input
- `get point transforms` VOP - from second input
- `solve curve` - set targets and ctrl & ctrl files
   - type curve: must match type curve from ctrl curve  input
- `set transform` VOP - > points and xforms to out
https://youtu.be/ZUBSQ-2BkMo?t=1071




### Control geometry
`Control`(or any geo) +  prim name     
`AtachControlGeo` -

- `attach joint geo` (as 3op of pose tool) still technical approach. (next release for artists approach)


- motion trails (animation style) in SOP
---

# Capture
Rigs as operations - a separation of concerns. (Shadow rig) hierarchy to control rig > clean for export

## Capture soft

<img src="/src/kine/skin.png" width="350">   


Capture workflow nodes:   
1. [ **Bone Capture Line** ] SOP - define capture regions @joints    
2. [ **Tet Embed** ] SOP - create mesh weightings   op2 bonecapture
3. [ **Bone Capture Biharmonic** ] SOP - transfers weights to skin op1: , op2: tet   

### Paint Capture
[ **Capture Layer Paint** ] SOP - (per region name  so semi procedural)


## Capture rigid

`capturePackedGeo` - check pack input>unpack Output . manual capture: geo: * joint name of joint


---


# Rig Wrangle

`rotate(3@localtransform, @Time, {1,0,0});` -    
`prerotate(3@localtransform, @Time, {1,0,0});` -  it applies the rotation to the matrix before move. Usefull!


# Rig Attrib VOP
[ **rigattribvop** ] SOP - chops and more stuff
You can drag points to get vectors from viewport. (in`Get Point Transform` VOP) and sav to `Set Point Transform` VOP



#### VOPS


##### Lookat

`Lookat (kinefx)` or `Lookat Constraint` - drag 3 vectors from viewport

can build constraints
- parentconstraint
