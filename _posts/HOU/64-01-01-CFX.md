# Muscle



- muscle + tissue (- fdm in future now vellum) Required bones geometry
 - muscle solidify (tets mesh)
 - fiber groom.
 - muscle properties
 - draw muscle tension lines.
 - muscle flex - animate tension

# Groom

## Principles


#### Flow
This is the general perception of the macro structure of the groom, influenced by the external forces and behavior of the subject.
- like curl  
- Longer hairs have more flow  

#### Clumps
Groups of hair that generate the mid levels of detail on the groom, from big clumps to the smaller group of at least 2 hairs.
- attraction point is like curve
- profile and shape change. (height of force ) if force is further than len. Tips are not touching each other. If is low clump is a massive

#### Per Strand
This is on hair level, each hair has different characteristics that define the micro level, but can overwrite the macro levels too.

#### [Hair Generate]
1. Skin geometry  
2. Guides (if not quick in geo)    
3. Skin animation

`@density`, `@length` - can be painted befor

# Guide



#### [Guide Process]   
Procedural. Operators to wrok with attributes and maps

- `Bend` - (in root, constant  or attrib direction)    
- `Set Direction`     
- `Lift`     
- `Length`    
- `Straighten`    
- `Smooth`    
- `Wave` - like 2d noise freq and ampli     
- `Frizz` - like 3d noise . Frequ (1 big / 100 super small)    

#### [ Guide Groom ]
Paint with Cache! try to have `Guide process` after `Guide groom` to update nicely

Brushes:  
- `Plant Guides` - (paint new)   
- `Part` - driving toward surface (repeling) \\ not stationary ? (stripes on cats ?)   
- `Clump` - project on the skin to a point (projection of attraaction) // stationary brush. [ctrl] to controll
- `Cut` -  
- `Extend` - it follow projection from cam. (zbrush snake like)  
- `Lift` -


#### [Guide Colide]
Surface offset to lift up hairs.
1. guide  (in hair gen its is  second inso need to cross it)
2. skin  
3. vdb



## Advect from curve
Gude groom with curve advected by volume

[GuideAdvect](https://youtu.be/wgX9HH4S_xs)

#### [ Guide Advection ]  
1. Guides (from HairGen)    
2. Skin geometry     
3. Skin VDB     
4. Velocity  (volume from curve)  

#### [ Volume From Curve ]
1. Curve (drawcurves on surface)  
2. Skin    
3. Skin VDB   



## Hair  

### `[Hair Clump]`
> Not use on guide use on hairs.  unless you need st specific.

1. Hair cut  
2. Skin
