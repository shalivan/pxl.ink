# Groom principles



##### Flow
This is the general perception of the macro structure of the groom, influenced by the external forces and behavior of the subject.
- like curl  
- Longer hairs have more flow  

##### Clumps
Groups of hair that generate the mid levels of detail on the groom, from big clumps to the smaller group of at least 2 hairs.
- attraction point is like curve
- profile and shape change. (height of force ) if force is further than len. Tips are not touching each other. If is low clump is a massive

##### Per Strand
This is on hair level, each hair has different characteristics that define the micro level, but can overwrite the macro levels too.

# Workflow



<img src="/src/groom/basicgroom.png" width="250">  

# Nodes

## Create
#### `[Hair Generate]`  
1) Skin geometry  
2) Guides (if not quick in geo)    
3) Skin animation

## Advect
Gude groom by volume advected curve

[GuideAdvect](https://youtu.be/wgX9HH4S_xs)

#### `[Guide Advection]`   
1. Guides (from HairGen)    
2. Skin geometry     
3. Skin VDB     
4. Velocity  (volume from curve)  

##### `[Volume From Curve]`
1. Curve (drawcurves on surface)  
2. Skin    
3. Skin VDB   


## Guide

#### `[Guide Groom]`
> Paint with Cache! try to have `groom process` after `guide groom` to update nicely

Brushes:  
`Plant Guides` - (paint new)   
`Part` - driving toward surface (repeling) \\ not stationary ? (stripes on cats ?)   
`Clump` - project on the skin to a point (projection of attraaction) // stationary brush. [ctrl] to controll
`Cut` -  
`Extend` - it follow projection from cam. (zbrush snake like)  
`Lift` -

#### `[Guide Process]`   
> Procedural. Operators to wrok with attributes and maps

`Bend` - (in root, constant  or attrib direction)    
`Set Direction`     
`Lift`     
`Length`    
`Straighten`    
`Smooth`    
`Wave` - like 2d noise freq and ampli     
`Frizz` - like 3d noise . Frequ (1 big / 100 super small)    

#### `[Guide Colide]`
  - surface offset to lift up hairs.
1. guide  (in hair gen its is  second inso need to cross it)
2. skin  
3. vdb

## Hair  

### `[Hair Clump]`
> Not use on guide use on hairs.  unless you need st specific.

1. Hair cut  
2. Skin
