# Shading

When light hit surface it can be:
- reflection
- absorption
- transmission


Pyro shaders are ok 



#### Diffuse
#### Albedo
#### Base Color
Albedo multip: - sth with absorbtion

#### Specular
- any point of surface

- dielectric: 2-8%
- semi-conductor  8-40$
- metal - 40 +
#### Fresnel
- at any angle  (Is spec refl !)

#### Roughness

-----

#### Absorption
we see colors throughh absorption (color are absorbed by heat)

 BLACK BODY IS NOT ONLY A PERFECT ABSORBER BUT ALSO A PERFECT emitter of heat. Hence the black container will cool down faster.


 Dark-colored materials absorb visible light better than light-colored materials. That's why the dark side of the card heats up first.


### IOR
for dielectric ~1.3

RefractiveIndex.Info
PixelAndPoly.com

higher ior is , slower light will travel .
bend on border of values

### Anisotropic
directional refl

### Sheen
subtle dif rough

### Corat
double highlights


#### transparency
- ray limitatins - up refl and refr limits
if black resoults to low limits

### Sub Surf
single scattering - like a marble. will soften a shadows
random walk -new one

#### Tansparency
- transmition @ distance (at what distance will be fully trans. color ) : how its color wwhen going throu medium


-0--
###### lambertian reflection
All diffuse is technicaly subsurface but not visible
water based body liki skin have deeper

### Prinvipal shader
### .. ?


more dense mats ~ more ior > so more spec
