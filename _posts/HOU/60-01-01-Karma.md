SHIFT R = >> to karma

### Karma node:

#### Outputs

- MPlay - can set up to send to MPlay
- Driver - Progressive / Buckets (with progresisve passes +1 ) fastest way tofrist pixel

# Karma render options

### Karma render options tabs



#### Pixel samples
Main quality driver
- 1 - 1 sek
- 8 - 22 sek
- 32 - acceptable
- 128 - 360 sek
- 256 - 600 sek


#### Noise level main
Indirect rays !!!!

+ Min/Max rays - how much samples shot from shading point
- `Path Traced` - progressive like in viewport (not final )
- `Distributed` - Ability to change on types
- `Variance` -  Min Max

advanced tab > noise level in  drive min and max.
lower noise level  will shoot more max 0.005 very clean.   

#### Oracle
Pixel sample thershold
- on/off
- treshold

- varaince  like in min/max

#### Light quality

can multiply samples in light (karma settings and increeese to 3,6,9...)

#### Dicing
Most on reflection

# Shading

When light hit surface it can be:
- reflection
- absorption
- transmission


Pyro shaders are ok

## Shaders


## MaterialX
.mtlx

- `material standard surface` -
- `mtlxUsdPrimvarReader` - bind attribs/ get attrib
- `mtlxfractal3d` - noise



### Principal shader


### Other

usd previews surfaces - poor only for usd   
kma_pyro preview - karma pyro for XPU


## Features




#### Diffuse
#### Albedo
#### Base Color
Albedo multip: - sth with absorbtion

#### Specular
- any point of surface

- dielectric: 2-8%
- semi-conductor  8-40$
- metal - 40 +
#### Fresnel
- at any angle  (Is spec refl !)

#### Roughness

-----

#### Absorption
we see colors throughh absorption (color are absorbed by heat)

 BLACK BODY IS NOT ONLY A PERFECT ABSORBER BUT ALSO A PERFECT emitter of heat. Hence the black container will cool down faster.


 Dark-colored materials absorb visible light better than light-colored materials. That's why the dark side of the card heats up first.


### IOR
for dielectric ~1.3

RefractiveIndex.Info
PixelAndPoly.com

higher ior is , slower light will travel .
bend on border of values

### Anisotropic
directional refl

### Sheen
subtle dif rough

### Corat
double highlights


#### transparency
- ray limitatins - up refl and refr limits
if black resoults to low limits

### Sub Surf
single scattering - like a marble. will soften a shadows
random walk -new one

#### Tansparency
- transmition @ distance (at what distance will be fully trans. color ) : how its color wwhen going throu medium


-0--
###### lambertian reflection
All diffuse is technicaly subsurface but not visible
water based body liki skin have deeper

more dense mats ~ more ior > so more spec
