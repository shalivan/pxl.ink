# COP
### Space
-  `(- 1, -1)` to `(1, 1)` where 0 is in the middle 
- Layer  Have resolution 

# COP export to material
in the mat/principal: texture, Quickshade SOP /texture sample or Attrib from map:  
`op:'opfullpath(../)'`   - can `Ctrl` + `C` COP node
`/op:img/copNetName`      



### Sgnatures 
### Signature convert 

### Layer 
Have resolution 
[Size Settings]



# Nodes 


- `File` - open from disk
- `ROP_image` - You can drag outputs  

- `FractalNoise` - 
- `TilePattern` 


- `Ramp` -  can be sphere 
- `Equalize` / `Remap` 
-  `Blend` - add multiply over max min ...  / `Wipe` -  Blend with mask (transition) can blend mono  signature
- `HSV` - color correction
- `Compare` - difference 
- `Function` - Math node 


`SopImport`  - bring geometry, then: 
-  `RasterizeGeo` - can rasterize from camera and grab any attribs  - `RasterizeSetup` - before to get `@origP` 
- `Geometry to layer` - ie heightmap, similar to rasterize 
- `Stamp points`

Stamp points!!
- `Stam Points`- Require points > sop import > enter node, make grid 2x2 in XY plane > Scatter points. / You can use attribs on points 
Segment by connectivity
- `Random Mono`

Filters 
- `Blur` / `Feather` - more bevel like, you can feather from in or outside / `Bokhe` - 
- `DilateErode` - Reshape 
- `Glow` `Chromaticabberation` `Quantize` 
- `Convolve` - sharpen  / `Kuwahara` - 

- `Auto Stereogram` - require tillable input - adjust size based on depth mask 
- `Median` - some kind of blur 
- `StreakBlur` - directional blur
- `Distort` - shift uv  / `Distort by slope` - more nodes 
- `Slop direction` / W&B to direction
- `Derivative` - changes in value / `Edge Detect` - difference in value light / dark, `Edge Detect Depth` - Outside edge of geometry,   `Edge Detect Normal` - Internal edges `Edge Detect Counture` - shilluettes 
- `Heirght to AO`

Comp
- Slap comp import - Add AOVs from last render - give aovs from viewport 
- Slap comp block  - to use and see in wievport !
