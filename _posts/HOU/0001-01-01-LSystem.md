# Turtle commands
#### Move and Rot (d0L)
`F` Move forward a step, drawing a line connecting the previous position to the new position.  
`f` Move forward without drawing.  
`+` Rotate right 90 degrees.  
`-` Rotate left 90 degrees.  

#### Parameters
`F(l,w,s,d)` - `l` - distance / `w` - width / `s` - cross sections divisions (rows) / `d` - divisions (columns)   

#### Direction and branches  (bracketed systems)
`F+(45)F` - change direction   

`F[+F]F[+F][-F] ` - branching  

Rewriting
`A` - Init
`A=F+A`-  Rule
#### 3d

`&` - pitch up  
`^` - pitch down  
`\\` - roll clockwise  
`/` - roll counter-clockwise  
`"` - command makes the F commands half length in each generation, which makes the branches shrink further out.  

stochastic systems (to add divergence using probabilities;
parametric systems (using conditions

context sensitive systems
two-rule system will take twice as many generations to produce the same result.

# Recursive fractals
recursively replacing an initial state

## Koch snowflake
- Angle = 60   
- Premise `F++F++F`    
- Rule 1 `F = F-F++F-F`  

## Sierpinski triangle
- Angle = 60  
- Premise `F--G--G`  
- Rule 1 `F = F--G++F++G--F`  
- Rule 2 `G = GG`
