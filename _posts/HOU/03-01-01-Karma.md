`SHIFT` + `R` = >> to karma


#### Outputs

- `MPlay` - can set up to send to MPlay
- `Driver` - Progressive / Buckets (with progresisve passes +1 ) fastest way tofrist pixel

### Rerender fragment
- Data Windows NDC


#### Workflow to optimise

1. turn off indirect and get direct light clean (if note it will continue spreading wrong resoults)
2. Sometimes render x2 resolution but 1/2 samples > deniose > scale down get sharpen edges and more details with same times.  (especially for motion). Works only because of noise consistency Karma is producing.
3. sequences

# Karma render settings

 `Karma Render Properties`  - Can add multiple Render settings.

## Karma sampling

#### Pixel samples
Main quality driver.    Pixel Samples Multiplayer.
Values: 32 - acceptable / 128 - clean    
**Render Times**: Predictable - doubles when param doubles.  and have linear relation with render size

#### Indirect rays
How much samples shot from shading point.
**Convergence mode**: (how total ray samples are calculated) (montecarlo convergence)
- `Variance` - Default `Min` / `Max` - treshold ! advanced tab > noise level is  drivng min and max. lower noise level  will shoot more max 0.005 very clean.   
    - Min -
    - Max - 9 / 12 / 30 - Small increase in render times. But pixel sample is doing more cleaning.
- `Distributed` - Manual - Ability to change on types - so in specific situations when scene have one type of rays
- `Path Traced` - progressive like in viewport (not final) - longer with lot of bounce lights. (can help with far a way ropes)


#### Noise levels
Fine detail levels. check if its noise or not enough samples    
- 0.02 noisy / 0.01 default / 0.005 max / below its not super cleaner (not shooting more rays)
Render times can increas much



#### Oracle
Variance pixel samples, based on  noise level at selected rendre pass (ie. beauty pass) during rendering
Will ignore darker values more. If noise is everywhere oracle will go to max pix samples
(Amount ovf variance that trigers more rays )
Pixel sample thershold
Im wię◙kszy tym wiekszy musi byc noise zeby odpalił dodatkowe raye
- varaince  like in min/max

Turn of by setting to `uniform`



#### Limits
How many bounces allowed. Can save a lot of render time
Bounces GI - 3 is enough for sky (is slow and more change not so much) / for sunlight will change  
Color limit - will darken when to low


**Russian Roulette** - Killing some samples in every next bounce. Value is number of bounce when to start reducing. Its good to use cause after 2 bounce rays ale much less important. At 0 will kick of quickly and produce noise.

---

#### Light quality
Global multiplayer. Specific setups in light actors directly.
Sampling mode
- `Light Tree` beneficial when lot of lights. gnerally good
- `Uniform` - single light

1- minimum to work but its ok. No need to increase in simple scenarios

#### Volumes

----

#### Dicing
Effect on pieces we don't see that is reflected or use indirect ilu.
Multiply - for reflection and refraction & displacement.
Default ok.


#### Indirect  Guide

Can optimize indirect bounces
Will initialize with pre pass
- not big quality difference. - expensive not always change q.

## Denoise

Workflow with denoiser: - increase resolution, decreas pixel samples   
can soften small details ,

##### Denoise in COP
Need 2 additional passes, `Albedo`, `N` .        
1. File (load render passes)
2. Denoise AI  
How low samples can use with denoise
3. Scale down



Image output > filters > Denoiser
OCIO (open color) Add 1
 - Output space 'ACES - ACEScg'
 - Input Space: data


# Lights
Interior render with area lights in windows
- `dome light` especially with texture is harder to calculate
- `spot light`
- `aera lights`- not better than doom but direct tan be little bit cleaner.
- `portal lights` - to focus render but same quality in karma not huge effect

```
not all lights work with xpu
xpu dont use exposure. (change in intensity )
```

#### IES
can download from pixar renderman site

# Shading



When light hit surface it can be:
- reflection
- absorption
- transmission

---

## Shaders

- `USD Preview surface` - need uv nodes and dont have subsurface. Basic one !  poor only for usd  
- `MaterialX` - for Karma XPU -
- `Pyro` - shaders are ok
- `Karma Pyro preview`  - karma pyro for XPU
- `Lens Shader` - inside camera use lens shade (must be mat context not material lib )  - can add distortion and aberration

## MaterialX
- `mtlx Material Standard Surface` -

### MaterialX nodes
- `mtlx Const` - value
- `mtlx Usd Prim Var Reader` - bind attribs / get attrib
- `mtlx Image` - Load texture
- `mtlx Image` > `mtlx Normal Map`- Load texture
- `mtlx Fractal 3d` - noise


- Displacement: - `Collect` node - can plug in mtlx in  `mtlx image` > `mtlx remap` Color FA > `mtlx displacement`
- Volume: - `mtlx Volume`
   - `vdf` - volume > `mtlx anisotropic vdf` set absorption&scattering > `mtlx Geompropvalue` geomprop: density > set value  
   - `edf` emmition


## Features

- Diffuse
- Albedo
- Base Color
    Albedo multip: - sth with absorbtion
- Specular
 - any point of surface
   - dielectric: 2-8%
   - semi-conductor  8-40$
   - metal - 40 +
- Fresnel
   - at any angle  (Is spec refl !)
- Roughness
- Absorption
   - we see colors throughh absorption (color are absorbed by heat)
   BLACK BODY IS NOT ONLY A PERFECT ABSORBER BUT ALSO A PERFECT emitter of heat. Hence the black container will cool down faster.
   Dark-colored materials absorb visible light better than light-colored materials. That's why the dark side of the card heats up first.
- IOR
  - for dielectric ~1.3
  [RefractiveIndex.Info](RefractiveIndex.Info)
  [PixelAndPoly.com](PixelAndPoly.com)
   - higher ior is , slower light will travel .
   - bend on border of values
   - more dense mats ~ more ior > so more spec
- Anisotropic
  - directional refl
-  Sheen - subtle dif rough
-  Coat - double highlights
- Transparency
  - ray limitatins - up refl and refr limits
    if black resoults to low limits
- Sub Surf - single scattering - like a marble. will soften a shadows
     random walk -new one
- Tansparency
- Transmition @ distance (at what distance will be fully trans. color ) : how its color wwhen going throu medium

###### lambertian reflection
All diffuse is technicaly subsurface but not visible
water based body liki skin have deeper

# Camera
### DOF
under view: - `focal len` and `horizontal  aparture` .    
Dof - `Shift` + `F`  - show plane / `Shift` + `Click LMB` -  to show when to shift         
F- stop - how much blur
### Blur

#### Motion Blur
On movement
1. need to `Cache`  
2. in camera `shatter open`, `shatter closed`

#### Velocity Blur    
relay on attribute
- `v` - geometry  
- `vel` - vdb grid / vector grids

----

### AOV (Render Vars)
- passes
- `beauty` - default
- `C` plane - is beauty pass


##### LPE Tags
Divide light s to componenets for evey light  
Compose in COP
- delete channel
- rename channels
- `screen ` mode  if rendered with taged layers.

##### Cryptomats
render vars

##### Deep camera maps.
heavy - volume information's. can compo with semi
