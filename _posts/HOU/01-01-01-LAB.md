# VAT 3

- Two additional triangles - > bounds of sim  > frame nr , padding ratio in @P data
- 2 uv channels (16 bit depth) instead of vert color to store Pivot pos.
- accuracy modes. (more memory intensive)

Features:
- interpolation for moving pieces
  - for rot (slerp - spherical linera had limitations (2 ways to solve) > multi ref lerp can spin multiple times f2f (ang velo how fast and whitch dir) but in straight line > reconstuct frame trajectory, (compute acceleration))
-





## Soft

##### Position alpha vs. rot texture
-  `Rotation Texture` rot tex as quat to heve add normal. tangent space nm > (tangent data to shader, with only normal they can spin around nm. (rotation texture (tan + nm ) added  as quaternion (can describe both degrees of freedom simultaniousley using 4 not 6 chanles)))
- `Export Compressed Normals in Position Alpha` - lossy compression resulting in medium-quality normals. more memory-efficient alternative as it bypasses the cost of sampling Rotation Texture.


## Dynamic
Flud potentially remeshed every frame
Dynamic Remeshing (Fluid) mode requires you to render output files in two separate passes !!!!!

### Fuse 
Turn this off if you do not want to fuse any points.
###### Fuse Point Group:
The point group that will be affected by fusing. Points will be fused together if they are within the distance threshold set by *Fuse Distance*. You can also use the "!group_name" or "* ^group_a_name ^group_b_name" syntax to exclude certain groups. When this parameter is blank, all points will be affected.
###### Fuse Distance:
Fuses together points within this distance to one another in the input geometry. This helps to remove tiny triangles that are a waste of resources and potentially problematic.


###   Export Compressed Normals in Position Alpha:
        Compresses the normals from the vector type to the float type and stores them in Position Texture's alpha channel. This is a lossy compression resulting in medium-quality normals. If you do not plan to apply regular (tangent-space) surface normal maps to your real-time asset, this is a more memory-efficient alternative as it bypasses the cost of sampling Rotation Texture. But if you want to apply regular normal maps, turn this off and use Rotation Texture instead. Turning this on also precludes you from exporting a custom attribute through Position Texture's alpha channel.

###   Export Surface UVs in Position Alpha and Color Alpha:
        Exports the animated UV attributes through Position Texture's alpha channel and Color Texture's alpha channel. Dynamic Remeshing (Fluid) mode can support UV maps, but since the topology is dynamic, the input geometry has to be UV unwrapped on every frame. You can either UV unwrap the input geometry yourself (recommended) or rely on the auto UV generation method specified on the *Input* tab.

###   Export Surface UVs in Color Red and Green:
        Exports the animated UV attributes through Color Texture's red and green channels. Dynamic Remeshing (Fluid) mode can support UV maps, but since the topology is dynamic, the input geometry has to be UV unwrapped on every frame. You can either UV unwrap the input geometry yourself (recommended) or rely on the auto UV generation method specified on the *Input* tab.


### cheap
mem efficient / low quality
uv > Alpha cahan of pos tex (V3 into float ? )
- H: export compressed normals in pos alpha
- U: Check export compressed normals in position A
- U: Internal use compressed normals

### Sec tier
+ rotation map
- U: Compressed normals are in pos alpha NO !

### motion blur







## Rigid
Packed pieces with RBD simulation data. small textures !

#### Accuracy of the pivot
Determines the accuracy of piece translations and rotations
- **High** use if vertex shader is a performance bottleneck; uses `two 16-bit UV channels` to store unencoded pivots; the overall cheapest option
- **Very High** recommended; uses `two 16-bit UV channels` to store encoded pivots; deploys two split-encoding formats and dynamically pick the better format for each piece, producing an accuracy very close to that of "Maximum" at only half of the latter's memory footprint; costs more vertex shader instructions.
- **Maximum**  uses `two 32-bit UV channels` to store unencoded pivots;  (*Use Full Precision UVs* in Mesh Editor). Because Rigid-Body Dynamics (Rigid) mode requires 4-6 UV channels on the exported mesh, turning on Use Full Precision UVs doubles the memory footprints for all of them.

#### Rotation Interpolation
- **Accurate Multi-RPF Slerp with Angular Velocity** - Default. allows you to freely dilate time in real-time playbacks & multi rotation. Use unless no `@w` If your input geometry comes from a RBD simulation, angular velocity is directly available.  `@w`- point attrib. (angular-velocity-assisted spherical linear interpolation (slerp) algorithm to fairly accurately interpolate rotations of fast-spinning pieces)
- **Basic Short-Path Slerp without Angular Velocity** - uses the standard short-path spherical linear interpolation (slerp) algorithm.


#### Support Smoothly Interpolated Trajectories:
- This requires you to export `Color Texture` and set Texture Format to `HDR`.
    It recomputes accelerations and exports them through the RGB channels of `Color Texture`. Using accelerations, the shader can reconstruct curved interframe trajectories in a more realistic way which take velocites into account, instead of constructing straight paths to connect adjacent-frame positions.  

#### Edge Case Handling     
- Max RPF Allowed - `50`   Limit revolutions per frame ( too high may affect the accuracy of the rotation interpolation for all pieces due to floating point precision limitations )
- Slerp Edge Case Offset - (Do not set this value too low, or the real-time shader may suffer from numerical errors. )
- Slerp Edge Case Seed - generating random degrees by which to rotate edge-case pieces. (extremely unlikely that you will need to change this parameter. Only change it if the node displays an error message that asks you to do so.)

- VAT3 interpolation  interfarme-interpolation`
- VAT3 `smooth interpolated trajectories` (in circ motion)  in U & H
```

Other name for VErtex color `cd_v` ?




### Rigid not from sim
- not throu solver , njo rdb data : orient, pivot
Use transform pieces:
- packed pieces:
 - first frame `freez` (ref)
 - `extract transform`
 - `transform pieces`. Attribute to copy: `pivot, orient`

### Piece scale multiply
- by vector
- can scale by velo with `MF_TransformVelocity` (localspaceVeloInUnreal Out) > (localspacePieceScaleMultiplayer) in `FM_VAT_RigidbodyDynamics`


### Support for ISM & HISM
also mesh particles or 4h2 ?
- H: support real time instancing  checkbox
- H export tab: Include: geo, pos, rot , col / realtime data
- U: import data table, support table  check
- U: use scripted action under RMB


### LOD
Shared point data








## Particle
- VAT3 added  interpolation
- VAT3 custom card

### Looping partiles
- make loop SOP > last frame shorter
- can spin with nm
- steer by velocity  (export velo and apply )
