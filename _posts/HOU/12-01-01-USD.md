# USD

http://www.usdmanager.org/about.html



## Root layer stack Paradigm

- **Primitives**: fundamental building blocks  / hierarchical structure. Primary container object.
- **Properties**:  named * typed data on primitives / attributes & relationships. Secondary container object.
- **Paths**: (**Namespace**) precise locations in the scene hieratchy / primitives & properties (like a file paths on disk)
- **Layers**: bundles of primitives and other properties / vontains opinions / in-memory & ment to be saved on disk
- **Layer Stacks**: ordered collection of contributing layers (sublayers)
- **Root Layer Stacks**: foster collaborative workflows / common scene description / no one has to build their scene

.

- **Stage** Scene (loadeld file / composed)
- **Model** - Everything that contribute to asset with exclusive 'kind' type.
    - only group model prims can have oyher model children.
    - A prim can only be a model id its prim is also (group) model
    - No prrim should have exact kind 'model'.
    - find with calls in vex: `usd_ismodel()` `usd_kind()` python: `UsdPrim::IsModel` `UsdModelAPI::GetKind`

---

- Primary container object: Primitives and Attributes (secondary).
- Primitives can contain other Primitives creating a namespace hierarchy on stage  

We always work 'against/relative' to stage.
- Worls vs local space (tarnsforms, velocity/acceleration, motion blur)
- Duplicate date (e.g. subdiv settings/topology attributes) vs writing to sparsley
- Use stage mertrics (fps/shutter sample count/material binding) to drive SOP settings.


# ASWF  Asset Structuring Guidelines

## Kind
A method of defining hierarchy on primitives (like tag) help define role in hierarchy. In most pipelines should be automated. authoring: (like in sop import / configure primitive).  Can help in selection. (can change behavior's type in selection RMB menu)

- **All geometry is one component**
- **Nested groups and component** - Auto set: xform as group / geometry as component - component only on root levels  
- **Nested assembly group and components** - for dense hierarchy tree.
- should be **class primitive** and models will inherent from it.

```
/Models <group
  /Characters <group  
    /CharacterA <assembly (ready to put in to scene)  
      /Skin <component
        /mesh
      /Addons <component
        /mesh
    /CharacterB <assembly (ready to put in to scene)  
  /Props  <group  
    /Props1 <assembly (ready to put in to scene)  
      /mesh  ??
      /mesh  ??
```

### Component
Cannot contain groups or asemblies! Only able to contain Subcomponents. (most of time when import sops or smaller assets.)
- component models are publishable assets that keep their geo behind a payload
- most nasic asset published in a USD

### Subcomponent
An important primitive inside a component (e.g. a door pivot)


### Assembly
An important group. Usually a published asset or reference to one.     
 (ready to put in to scene)  
 Bring togheter other componenets
- Assembly models are publishable assets which reference components or other assebly assets


### Group
Can contain components, groups, or assemlies. Most flexible.



## Properties ?

### Selectors
??
Selectors:
- Leaf geometry - Leaf - 'end of a hierarchy branch' no childs  
- Component
- Subcomponent
- Model
- Group
- Assembly
- Point Instance (top level)
- Point Instance (leaf)


### Purpose
 configure primitive node.

## Layers
Need to export
can set in `SOP import` or `Configure layer`

####
Variant layers can be stored separat files or all in one layer
 - one file - reduce num of layers / somple management
 - multiple - easier for tools or pipelines (like for layout lop in solaris)


# I/O
Save control:
 - Implicit - will save layer on usd path . so path not set. Not clean. Better have controll.  
Save Path  


## Composition arc

### LIVRPS hierarchy:  
**Opinion strength** ordering in each LayerStack- overrides permissions when merging you can use same asset and it will use one with stronger opinion.  
1. `Locals` / `Sublayers` - A file on disk stacked with strenght order. Combine like photoshop (sublayers per department or steps like geo, mat... )
2. `Inherets ` - Like C++ classes. (keep insances alive). manage materials.
3. `VariantSet` - Variant is single named variation of VariantSet (primitiv located in scene graph) / lod, variations...  - For switching between items in a collection.  
4. `References` - Add a new item to your scene  
5. `Payloads` - - References with optional deferred loading. Optimization's  (not to load until they are needed)  
6. `Specials` - materials tweaks - Inherits with some special properties.


## Formats
refer to geo in hierarchical way. Can be extended by plugins to use other formats   
`.usd` - [binary] or [ASCII]   
`.usdc` [binary] Crate files. -Compressed, faster to access. Best for large geo.     
`.usda` - [ASCII] human readable format. For debug and experiment, can open like usd   
`.usdz` - Support for collection of files in zip (like mesh and textures)  

## File Structure

file.usd > payload.usdc > geo.usdc / mtl.usdc
- payload >> what to show / load 

Variant layers:
separate file vs all in one layer

## Setup Asset file inside USD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Make scene with light to use all the time.


1) componentgeometry:
import fbx file >
https://youtu.be/HgEwvTjmrgE
Outputs:
- required - for render
- proxy - viewport
- simproxy

2) component material

3) material library
- to 2op of componentmaterial  
- setup material x
4) component output
- name it
- thumb it
- SAVE TO DISK

!!!!!!! now we have usd file.
how to update ???


BRING BACK SAVED FILE   
1) file node  
- import usd file
2) edit
- i.e: editMaterial node.
   - drag material from tree to node param details panel.

# SOP


Authoring geometry for USD use:
1. In SOPs:
 - name - Can drive Assemblies / Groups / Components
 - path Primitive attributer - Can drive Assemblies / Groups / Components
 - geometry Prim groups - USD Sub-component (geometry faces subset) useful but not part of composition ark
2. In LOPs: Load context: Use referencing vs ... ?
 - [x] `References` - sub layering tree. Adding new props. multiple input can import same asset only as ref.  
 - [ ]  `Sublayers` - attaching as a branch





```

## SOP <> USD

19:
Asset import
Add asset to library



### Component nodes
can quickly setup constructed asset  


18.5:  
Usd like packed primitives  

In SOP:
- SOP geometry prim groups
- Organized by 2 attributes `@name` + `@path` (prim) - with name in the end: `s@path = "/basicFolderForSolaris/" + s@name;` so path will be: /Folder/name (`/` is important)
   - s@path = "/Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree  ROOT !!
   - s@path = "Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree   RELATIVE PATHG !! (import path prefix in import sop LOP  now is dynamic)
In LOP:
- USD Assemblies, Groups, Components
- USD SubComponents, limited, only for materials .

### [usdexport] SOP
nested assembly, group and components.


```


### Assemble SOP  & geo SubsetGroups

IN SOPS: Assemble SOP can help with exporting to lops. > create groops.  >> In LOPs Subset Groups (are attributes of primitive. )

# LOP


## Solaris Viewport
- `Stage` - node view.
- `Scene Graph Tree` - Outliner with scene graph compose tree.
   - Scene Graph Path /
   - Primitive type: - xform, mesh /
   - Vatiants /
   - Kind - assembly, group, component. ()  
- `Scene Graph Layer` -
- `Layout Asset Gallery` - Asset Library



## Input


### [SOP Create] LOP


```
- subset groups like attrib / groups for assign materials
```

```
##### Load Layer
Open disk file

##### Sub Layer
Open disk file or  merge
```
### [SOP Import] LOP
Load From Sops.

- **Load as reference** checkbox.      
- **Packed Primitives** how to pack primitives.
   - Create point instancer - grab prototype. much optimised !!!! with much of points. (or for sim)
   - Native Instances - (prototype + huge hierarch blue instances )
   - Xform - kill instances
   - Unpack -  kill instances without nulls
- **Kind** authoring
- **Layer save path** - good to set a destination `$HIP/..usd`.

Subset groups to **preserve groups** !!!

### [SOP Scene Import] LOP
Import all from SOPs


### [Stage manager] LOP
by drag and drop.


### [Reference] LOP

---

## Variants

### Add Variant to existing primitives
Loop for adding variants.

1. Primitive path - set path to primitives u want to make variants for,


### Set Variant
Set one
---

SOP Modify LOP  
USD Configure SOP

-----

## Collection
Collection LOP
will author a collection primitives. like selction set. - will be saved in file. (overal usd)
Can add material to collection.

## Geometry subsets
- scale well, can attach materials
-----

## Materials
`Material Library`
`Assign material`
`Material Variation`
https://youtu.be/EcMq_DH-DnM


## Out

##### Configure Layer
- Write asset to disc.

##### USD ROP

- Write to disc   

## Manage


##### Prune
Isolate  (Primitive pattern)

##### Merge
Will create separated layers


##### Configure Primitives

- Purpose: Render(tylko w karmie)/Proxy(tylko w hydrze)/Guide




## Procedurals

##### Add Variant



## Material

Way to assign material:
- SOP path & name prim attributes > USD Assemblies/Group/Components
- SOP Geometry Prim Groups > USD Sub-Components

#####  Material Library
We can assign material to whatever level of hierarchy  
- Save with asset or alone ? - Zmienić materiał Path z - materials na barrel  


1. Use auto fill -  will create folder and import SOP mats
   - `Material network` > browse to mat context and choose existing materials even from SOPs
   - `USD Path Prefix` >
2. To assign geometry to created library in  `Geometry Path`
   - drag and drop geo from: Scene graph tree to get explicit path
   - write a filter ie;  `*geo*` to assign by name
3. Add new by hand
   - `Material VOP` - path to material  `../../mat/NameOfMyMat`
   - `Material Path` - we can name
   - `Geometry Path` - as in pt 2.



`material linker` ??? more artistic  visual than mat assign (For procedural)


##### Assign Material

Same less options

-----------


**[Layout]** LOP node
 - brush
 - edit


 `insertion points`! nod allow to move edits upstream !


-----------

----------


instance
----
stage manager > to folders
collection >  (name from folder)
instancer > %foldername )and add point inside !_

-----


```

1) scene import - import all < will be slower you need bake it and read in later.  - u can filter
2) not portable because have no folders so
   - destination path >> JAKIŚ_GLOWNY_FOLDER         (see prev in scene graph tree)
   - later be more specyfic and build hierarchy of your needs
we will divide by layers


LAYERING:
Sublayer LOP node <
1) import rest pose
2) sublayer anim
it will update only differences !!! (po prawej a wieksza opnie )
can set OPINIONS by: layer position


@Cd >> W USD: displayColor

MAT:
1) Mat lib
 - matx subnet.  >> mtlx standard
 - BEFORE PLUGIN BASE COLOR: convert jpg to aces ACES: karma_OCIO_transform  Utility - Linear - sRGB  >> ACES - ACEScg
 - BEFORE PLUGIN NORMAL:
 - mtlxgeometrycolor - vertex color // or geompropvalue z parametrem displayColor (Cd in sops)
-
2) assign mat
 -primitives: drag geo from scene graph
 - material path:
 - drag material from scene graph

LIGHT:

USD WORKFLOW !!!!!

1) reference < otworz
x) usd rop < zapisz
...?


VARIANTS:
- like lod i mozesz zmieniac
- 
```
