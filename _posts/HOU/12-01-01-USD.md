# USD

http://www.usdmanager.org/about.html


#### Format and files
refer to geo in hierarchical way.  
`.usdc` USD or Crate files. - Binary compressed fast to access.    
`.usda` - ASCII, human readable format. For debug and experiment, can open like usd   
`.usdz` - Support for collection of files in zip (like mesh and textures)  

can be extended by plugins to use other formats


Primary container object: Primitives (primary) and Attributes (secondary).
Primitives can contain other Primitives creating a namespace hierarchy on stage  


## Paradigm


- **Stage** = Scene (loadeld file / composed)
- Primitive and attributes are primary container objects **Every object is primitive**
- **Namespace** - path to obj in stage. Important!
- **Layer** - file on disk

## Composition Arc

### LIVRPS:  
**Opinion strength** ordering in each LayerStack- overrides permissions when merging you can use same asset and it will use one with stronger opinion.  
1. `Locals` / `Sublayers` - A file on disk stacked with strenght order. Combine like photoshop (sublayers per department or steps like geo, mat... )
2. `Inherets ` - Like C++ classes. (keep insances alive). manage materials.
3. `VariantSet` - Variant is single named variation of VariantSet (primitiv located in scene graph) - For switching between items in a collection.  
4. `References` - Add a new item to your scene  
5. `Payloads` - - References with optional deferred loading. Optimization's  (not to load until they are needed)  
6. `Specials` - materials tweaks - Inherits with some special properties.


---------------------

## Properties ?


### Kind
Should set Kind attribute to be able to edit group. (like tag) help define role in hierarchy. In most pipelines should be automated.
  - Assembly
  - Group
  - Component
  - Subcomponent

Can help in selection. (can change behavior's type in selection RMB menu)

**Kind** authoring: (like in sop import / configure primitive)
     - **All geometry is one component**
     - **Nested groups and component** - Auto set: xform as group / geometry as component - component only on root levels  
     - **Nested assembly group and components** - for dense hierarchy tree.

### Assembly


### Assemble SOP  & geo SubsetGroups

IN SOPS: Assemble SOP can help with exporting to lops. > create groops.  >> In LOPs Subset Groups (are attributes of primitive. )

```
### Selectors
??
Selectors:
- Leaf geometry
- Component
- Subcomponent
- Model
- Group
- Assembly
- Point Instance (top level)
- Point Instance (leaf)


### Purpose
 configure primitive node.

## Layers
Need to export
can set in `SOP import` or `Configure layer`

Save control
 - Implicit - will save layer on usd path . so path not set. Not clean. Better have controll.  
Save Path  

```

# LOP


#### Solaris viewport Views
- `Stage` - node view.
- `Scene Graph Tree` - Outliner with scene graph compose tree.
   - Scene Graph Path / Primitive type: - xform, mesh / Vatiants / Kind - assembly, group, component  
- `Scene Graph Layer` -
- `Layout Asset Gallery` - Asset Library



## Input
Authoring geometry for usd:
In SOPs:
- name - Can drive Assemblies / Groups / Components
- path Primitive attributer - Can drive Assemblies / Groups / Components
- geometry Prim groups - USD Sub-component (geometry faces subset) useful but not part of composition ark

In LOPs:    
Load context: Use referencing vs ... ?
- [x] `References` - sub layering tree. Adding new props. multiple input can import same asset only as ref.  
- [ ]  `Sublayers` - attaching as a branch


### SOP Create LOP


```
- subset groups like attrib / groups for assign materials
```

```
##### Load Layer
Open disk file

##### Sub Layer
Open disk file or  merge
```
### SOP Import LOP
Load From Sops.

- **Load as reference** checkbox.      
- **Packed Primitives** how to pack primitives.
   - Create point instancer - grab prototype. much optimised !!!! with much of points. (or for sim)
   - Native Instances - (prototype + huge hierarch blue instances )
   - Xform - kill instances
   - Unpack -  kill instances without nulls
- **Kind** authoring
- **Layer save path** - good to set a destination `$HIP/..usd`.

Subset groups to **preserve groups** !!!

### SOP Scene Import LOP
Import all from SOPs


### Stage manager LOP
by drag and drop.

---

## Variants

### Add Variant to existing primitives
Loop for adding variants.

1. Primitive path - set path to primitives u want to make variants for,


### Set Variant
Set one
---

SOP Modify LOP  
USD Configure SOP

-----

## Collection
Collection LOP
will author a collection primitives. like selction set. - will be saved in file. (overal usd)
Can add material to collection.

## Geometry subsets
- scale well, can attach materials
-----

## Materials
`Material Library`
`Assign material`
`Material Variation`
https://youtu.be/EcMq_DH-DnM


## Out

##### Configure Layer
- Write asset to disc.

##### USD ROP

- Write to disc   

## Manage


##### Prune
Isolate  (Primitive pattern)

##### Merge
Will create separated layers


##### Configure Primitives

- Purpose: Render(tylko w karmie)/Proxy(tylko w hydrze)/Guide




## Procedurals

##### Add Variant



## Material

Way to assign material:
- SOP path & name prim attributes > USD Assemblies/Group/Components
- SOP Geometry Prim Groups > USD Sub-Components

#####  Material Library
We can assign material to whatever level of hierarchy  
- Save with asset or alone ? - Zmienić materiał Path z - materials na barrel  


1. Use auto fill -  will create folder and import SOP mats
   - `Material network` > browse to mat context and choose existing materials even from SOPs
   - `USD Path Prefix` >
2. To assign geometry to created library in  `Geometry Path`
   - drag and drop geo from: Scene graph tree to get explicit path
   - write a filter ie;  `*geo*` to assign by name
3. Add new by hand
   - `Material VOP` - path to material  `../../mat/NameOfMyMat`
   - `Material Path` - we can name
   - `Geometry Path` - as in pt 2.



`material linker` ??? more artistic  visual than mat assign (For procedural)


##### Assign Material

Same less options

-----------


**[Layout]** LOP node
 - brush
 - edit


 `insertion points`! nod allow to move edits upstream !


-----------

## SOP <> USD

19:
Asset import
Add asset to library
### Component nodes
can quickly setup constructed asset  


18.5:  
Usd like packed primitives  

In SOP:
- SOP geometry prim groups
- Organized by 2 attributes `@name` + `@path` (prim) - with name in the end: `s@path = "/basicFolderForSolaris/" + s@name;` so path will be: /Folder/name (`/` is important)
   - s@path = "/Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree  ROOT !!
   - s@path = "Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree   RELATIVE PATHG !! (import path prefix in import sop LOP  now is dynamic)
In LOP:
- USD Assemblies, Groups, Components
- USD SubComponents, limited, only for materials .









### usdexport SOP
nested assembly, group and components.
