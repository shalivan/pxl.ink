# PDG
name index frame state id   
`@wedgeindex` - wedge individual index   
`@pdg_name` - PDG var   
`@pdg_output` - PDG var with sop path  
`@pdg_input` - see ropgeometry TOP  
`@pdg_input.0` - to access 1item in partitions  
`@pdg_input.1` - to access 2item in partitions  
Hda processor // create inputs ?   




[SOP_PDG.hiplc](/src/hip/SOP_PDG.hiplc)




These built in PDG variables are available everywhere any numberical attribute can be padded with :number. ( @pdg_index:4)
### Attributes

`@pdg_input` - always evaluates to the first input of the current workitem.  Use @pdg_input.1 and @pdg_input.2 etc. to address other inputs.  When a workitem is being evaluated on the farm, this is how to make sure the network being evaluated has the correct inputs for that workitem.  Do not use @pdg_output for this purpose, as the workitem has not computed yet and so has no output.  
`@pdg_output` - always evalutes to the first output of the current workitem.  Use @pdg_output.1 and @pdg_output.2 etc. to address other outputs. Useful for visualization purposes (eg. File sop with `@pdg_output` will display current workitem output if it's a geometry).  Do not use for other purposes.  
`@pdg_index` - the index of the current workitem - may not be unique within even a single processor.  Check in the case of your processor node.  
`@pdg_name` - the unique name of the current workitem.   
`@pdg_log` - the log file if present, available after a workitem has finished cooking.  
`@pdg_frame` - the frame of the workitem.  Will evaluate to 0 if the workitem doesn't have a frame.  
`@pdg_loopdepth` - set to the depth of the for loop.  So for example if you have a nested loop, the inner loop will have @pdg_loopdepth set to 1, and the other loop will be 0.

`@wedgeindex `




geo input in cache dile ``` `pdginput(0, "file/geo" , 0)` ```





### Nodes

##### `[RopFetch]`
- rop path (fbx rop / maps bake rop)

##### `[RopGeoOutput]`
- sop path to end of network node  
- path to save geometry (bgeo / obj)
