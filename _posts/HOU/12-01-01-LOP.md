# USD




#### Format and files
refer to geo in hierarchical way.  
`.usdc` USD or Crate files. - Binary compressed fast to access.    
`.usda` - ASCII, human readable format. For debug and experiment, can open like usd   
`.usdz` - Support for collection of files in zip (like mesh and textures)  

can be extended by plugins to use other formats




## Paradigm


- **Stage** = Scene (loadeld file / composed)
- Primitive and attributes are primary container objects **Every object is primitive**
- **Namespace** - path to obj in stage. Important!
- **Layer** - file on disk

## Composition Arc
### Layer composition:
1. `Sublayers` - Combine like photoshop - stack with strenght order.  Nondestructible overrides. - sublayers per department
2. `References` - Add a new item to your scene
3. `Payloads` - References with optional deferred loading. Optimisation
4. `Vatiants` - For switching between items in a collection.
5. `Inherits` - Like C++ classes.
6. `Specializes` - Inherits with some special properties.



### LIVRPS:  
**Opinion strength** ordering in each LayerStack- overrides permissions when merging you can use same asset and it will use one with stronger opinion.  
1. `Locals` - (layers - a file on disk)
2. `Inherets `-  manage materials
3. `VariantSet` - Variant is single named variation of VariantSet (primitiv located in scene graph)  
4. `References` -  
5. `Payloads` -  - like refs but possible to tell not to load until they are needed  
6. `Specials` - materials tweeks



---------------------

## Properties ?


### Kind
Should set Kind attribute to be able to edit group. (like tag) help define role in hierarchyh. In most pipelines should be automated.

  - Assmbly
  - Group
  - Component
  - Subcomponent


- Can setup in SOP import.
- Can setup in configure primitive.


### Selectors
??
Selectors:
- Leaf geometry
- Component
- Subcomponent
- Model
- Group
- Assembly
- Point Instance (top level)
- Point Instance (leaf)


### Purpose
 configure primitive node.

## Layers
Need to export
can set in `SOP import` or `Configure layer`

Save control
 - Implicit - will save layer on usd path . so path not set. Not clean. Better have controll.  
Save Path

# LOP
Solaris

#### Houdini wievport Views
- `Scene Graph Tree` - Outliner
   - Scene Graph Path / Primitive type: - xform, mesh / Vatiants / Kind - assembly, group, component  
- `Scene Graph Layer` -
- `Layout Asset Gallery` - Asset Library


----

# LOP nodes
## Input

- [x] `References` - subblayering tree. Adding new props. multiple input can import same asset only as ref.  
- [ ]  `Sublayers` - attachins as a branch


### SOP Create


```
- subset groups like attrib / groups for assign materials
```


##### Load Layer
Open disk file

##### SubLayer
Open disk file or  merge

### SOP Import
Load From Sops.

**Load as reference** checkbox.      

**Packed Primitives** how to pack primitives.
   - Create point instancer - grab prototype. much optimised !!!! with much of points. (or for sim)
   - Native Instances - (prototype + huge hierarch blue instances )
   - Xform - kill instances
   - Unpack -  kill instances without nulls

**Kind** authoring
   -
   -
   - Nested groups & Component - Auto set: xform as group / geometry as component
   - Nestyt Assembly group and componen.

**Layer save path** - good to set a destination `$HIP/..usd`.

Subset groups to preserve groups!!!

### SOP Scene Import
Import all from SOPs


### Stage manager
by drag and drop.

---

## Vatiants

### Add Variant to existing primitives
Loop for adding variants.

1. Primitive path - set path to primitives u want to make variants for,


### Set Vatiant
Set one
---

SOP Modify LOP  
USD Configure SOP

-----

## Out

##### Configure Layer
- Write asset to disc.

##### USD ROP

- Write to disc   

## Manage


##### Prune
Isolate  (Primitive pattern)

##### Merge
Will create separated layers


##### Cnfigure Primitives

- Purpose: Render(tylko w karmie)/Proxy(tylko w hydrze)/Guide




## Procedurals

##### Add Variant



## Material

Way to assign material:
- SOP path & name prim attributes > USD Assemblies/Group/Components
- SOP Geometry Prim Groups > USD Sub-Components

#####  Material Library
We can assign material to whatever level of hierarchy  
- Save with asset or alone ? - Zmienić materiał Path z - materials na barrel  


1. Use auto fill -  will create folder and import SOP mats
   - `Material network` > browse to mat context and choose existing materials even from SOPs
   - `USD Path Prefix` >
2. To assign geometry to created library in  `Geometry Path`
   - drag and drop geo from: Scene graph tree to get explicit path
   - write a filter ie;  `*geo*` to assign by name
3. Add new by hand
   - `Material VOP` - path to material  `../../mat/NameOfMyMat`
   - `Material Path` - we can name
   - `Geometry Path` - as in pt 2.



`material linker` ??? more artistic  visual than mat assign (For procedural)


##### Assign Material

Same less options

-----------


**[Layout]** LOP node
 - brush
 - edit


 `insertion points`! nod allow to move edits upstream !


-----------

## SOP <> USD

19:
Asset import
Add asset to library
### Component nodes
can quickly setup constructed asset  


18.5:  
Usd like packed primitives  

In SOP:
- SOP geometry prim groups
- Organized by 2 attributes `@name` + `@path` (prim) - with name in the end: `s@path = "/basicFolderForSolaris/" + s@name;` so path will be: /Folder/name (`/` is important)
   - s@path = "/Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree  ROOT !!
   - s@path = "Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree   RELATIVE PATHG !! (import path prefix in import sop LOP  now is dynamic)
In LOP:
- USD Assemblies, Groups, Components
- USD SubComponents, limited, only for materials .








### Assemble SOP  & geo SubsetGroups

IN SOPS: Assemble SOP can help with exporting to lops. > create groops.  >> In LOPs Subset Groups (are attributes of primitive. )

### usdexport SOP
nested assembly, group and components.
