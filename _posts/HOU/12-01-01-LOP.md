# Solaris

- Opinion strength - overrides permissions when merging you can use same asset and it will use one with stronger opinion  
- Stage = Scene
- Primitive and attributes are primary container objects Every object is primitive

#### USD
refer to geo in hierarchical way.  
`USDC` - crate geometry   
`USDA` - ASCII - light and properties   




## Paradigm




namespace - path to obj in stage. Important


Fixed scene graph location
- sublayers per department



#### Composition Arc
Opinion Strength Ordering in each LayerStack

LIVRPS:  
1. `Locals` - (layers - a file on disk)
2. `Inherets `-  manage materials
3. `VariantSet` - Variant is single named variation of VariantSet (primitiv located in scene graph)  
4. `References` -  
5. `Payloads` -  - like refs but possible to tell not to load until they are needed  
6. `Specials` - materials tweeks



#### Views
- `Scene Graph Tree` - Outliner! every node in file - so usefull !
- `Scene Graph Layer`
`stage` - loadeld file . composed  
- `Layout Asset Gallery` - Asset Library  for **[Layout]** LOP node



##### Kind & Selectors
(RMB) - usd concept with definitions :  use kind and selectors (select pratym!!!) to chose what u work on



Kind:
- kind authoring (sop import)
   - all geo is one component
   - nested geo and groups

Selectors:
- Leaf geometry
- Component
- Subcomponent
- Model
- Group
- Assembly
- Point Instance (top level)
- Point Instance (leaf)


------
Scene Graph Tree attributes:
- Scene Graph Path  
- Primitive type: - xform, mesh  
- Vatiants:
- Kind: assembly, group, component

# LOPs



## I/

layer - file on disk

##### SOP Import
Load as reference (*rohan do) > as payload  multiple input can import same asset only as ref.  
- import group import part of geo
- subset groups to preserve groups!!!
- default import with materials on tab.

##### Load Layer
Open disk file

##### SubLayer
Open disk file or  merge

##### Scene Import
import from SOPs

## /O

##### Configure Layer
- Write asset to disc.

##### USD ROP

- Write to disc   

## Manage


##### Prune
Primitive pattern - jak było dobrze podzielone to spoko  / like isolate

##### Merge
Will create separated layers


##### Cnfigure Primitives

- Purpose: Render(tylko w karmie)/Proxy(tylko w hydrze)/Guide




## Procedurals

##### Add Variant



## Material

Way to assign material:
- SOP path & name prim attributes > USD Assemblies/Group/Components
- SOP Geometry Prim Groups > USD Sub-Components

#####  Material Library
We can assign material to whatever level of hierarchy  
- Save with asset or alone ? - Zmienić materiał Path z - materials na barrel  


1. Use auto fill -  will create folder and import SOP mats
   - `Material network` > browse to mat context and choose existing materials even from SOPs
   - `USD Path Prefix` >
2. To assign geometry to created library in  `Geometry Path`
   - drag and drop geo from: Scene graph tree to get explicit path
   - write a filter ie;  `*geo*` to assign by name
3. Add new by hand
   - `Material VOP` - path to material  `../../mat/NameOfMyMat`
   - `Material Path` - we can name
   - `Geometry Path` - as in pt 2.



`material linker` ??? more artistic  visual than mat assign (For procedural)


##### Assign Material

Same less options

-----------


**[Layout]** LOP node
 - brush
 - edit


-----------

## SOP <> USD

19:
Asset import
Add asset to library
### Component nodes
can quickly setup constructed asset  


18.5:  
Usd like packed primitives  

In SOP:
- SOP geometry prim groups
- Organized by 2 attributes `@name` + `@path` (prim) - with name in the end: `s@path = "/basicFolderForSolaris/" + s@name;` so path will be: /Folder/name (`/` is important)
   - s@path = "/Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree  ROOT !!
   - s@path = "Barrels/next level/ name" + s@name; -  name change tree   RELATIVE PATHG !! (import path prefix in import sop LOP  now is dynamic)
In LOP:
- USD Assemblies, Groups, Components
- USD SubComponents, limited, only for materials .




USD Configure SOP

SOP Create LOP:
- subset groups like attrib / groups for assign materials

SOP Modify LOP



### Assemble SOP  & geo SubsetGroups

IN SOPS: Assemble SOP can help with exporting to lops. > create groops.  >> In LOPs Subset Groups (are attributes of primitive. )

### usdexport SOP
nested assembly, group and components.

stage manager > to folders
collection >  (name from folder)
instancer > %foldername )and add point inside !_

```



layer break  
edit scene  
save edits  

sop create


instancer - add point instances (
create lod - auto lod set


- merfe
- girafe
- leyers
- layout

sop geometry prim groups  - usd sub components - limited in USD (face set( FOR MATERIAL ASSIGNMENT
