**Voltage** volts **V** are - speed  (size of balloon) electric potential difference between two points
**Current** - amperes **A** - amount  (size of hole) rate of flow of electric charge past a point per unit of time.  "flow rate" lower current less wire u need.
**Power**  - watts -  1000 **W** = 1 **kW**   - energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1000 Wat) of power expended for one hour (1h)

Power = Voltage * Current
Power = 2 x Volt**  * 1/2 Current

Power * Time / 1000 = kWh
how much kWh for 1000 W per one hour = 1000 W * 1h /1000 = 1kWh 

12v - auta
48v - nowe auta


- current increases 2x > losses 4x.
- "voltages in series add up. napieczia przy szeregowym sie sumujÄ…

Work done = Force x Distance
force = mass x acceleration
Force = kg xms=2 = kgms-2
