# Plasticity


# UI 

##### Move
['RMB'] - move 
[`CMB`] - rotatet 

##### Selection filters 
`1`, ... `4` - points edge  (with shift can add) (with `tab` can  turn on all)


`Shift`- 
`Ctrl` - add edges in selction 
`Alt` - manual select chain  


`G` - move 
	- `X`, `Y` , `Z`
	- `Shift` + `X`  - in plane 
	- `G` - screen space 
	- `V` - move pivot 
`S`  - 
`R` - 



`Q` - Boolean
`Alt` + `X` - Mirror
`Shift` + `D` - Alternate duplicate 
`Alt` + `D` - Alternate duplicate 
`Ctrl` + `D` - Place. - Controlled duplicate (to the position and orient)  
`C` - cut solid with curve 


`Tab` - when creating can go throu dimnetionnumber sizes and fill them with numbrers by hand 



#### modeling on construction plane aligned to face 

Create plane from selection:

### Curves 

2x `LMB` - convert to bezier 
`B` with points selected - chamfer 
Refit - rebuild (smooth) - on left bottom bar 
`Shift` - add some snaps for construction plane
