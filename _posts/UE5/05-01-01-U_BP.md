# Blueprints
Blueprint Classes - create custom game object / prefabs


## Logic

Loops   
gates   
do once   
seq   

------


**Function** - similar to programing. execure code in freme was called.
- can communicate between BP. (can call from any but no: time /. delay )
- is processed once
- cheapest

**Macro** - collaps nodes.  better use fn. but support more than one exec pin (for logic)
- more expensive
- only in one BP cant communicate
- can delay anf time event
- for repetition things

**Events** - for latent (later) executions
    - `Begin Play` -
    - `Destory` -
    - `Trigger` -
    - `Tick` with delta (time elapsed from last call)

**Event Dispatchers** -  can subscribe and fire when triggered
- cad define in data tab.  
- to subscribe you bind dispatecher. can have many

**Function & macro library**


**Constructio script** - update on param change

# Actor

## Actor
- Can be spawned or loaded with level,
- Can make childs
- Can inherent components.
- Can be used ad component

## Scene Component
- attachements ...
- can hierarchy and suport transform to parent

## Acror component
-  more abstaract dont support transform
- used for path finding, movment.....

```
#### cast
when csting to objevt > casting to bp > so loading entire BP to memo




```

# Communicate between BP

#### Direct
#### Dispatcher
#### Interface





# Memory management

Clear intermediate BP and component to not have any ref, because all of them would be loaded wit BP   
CAn set Abstract !!!   
can only ref assets belonging to level ??!   
its good to move functionality to C++
## References to Assets


- actor ref - will load child and partnt  (specific obj) <<
- class ref - load children


#### Direct reference
are loaded whenever BP is loaded.

(reference viewer, and size map tools) !!!!


when wand where load to memory. Dependencies:
- `hard` will load whole asset. Attaching object to BP. Load in memory whenever BP is loaded. (hierarchical cascading )

#### Soft references
- delay load. Will not force, u must them explicitly load them


- `soft` 'link' is storing location.  Different way to acces it.
Lod soft
    - async load asset  (for individual or whole class)
    - cast to class
    - set (component to new mesh loaded to memory)
    - set to hard variable
Unload
  - no way > can destroy actor.
  - can threat like any uobject

  ( when created ref of given type, u need to load type to know that its soft )

#### inheretance
- Child BP implititly reference their patern classes and any asst they reference

#### Casting


#### Event Dispatchers








-------------

# Editor scripting

#### Widget utility.
Editor utility widget
can help automate tasks

#### Action utilities
- `RMB` events in level or browser

#### Editor utility
- in background listening
(like content validation)

#### Console comands
console comands & python

BP notes


set timer by event >> (delay) >> clear and invalidate timer by handle
