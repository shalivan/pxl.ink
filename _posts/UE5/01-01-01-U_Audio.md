# Sound Source

Thing in the audio engine which actually generates audio in the audio renderer. Source Sound (which may be a SoundWave, a SoundCue, a Synth, etc.

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/wav.png">


## Wave


## Metasounds

- Mixer, ESP node graph.  metasound is rendering of sound source (like advanced cue), so every source should have own metasound   Every metasound In background async task.
<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/cue.png">  
- only whole meta sound can be attenuated .
- atenuation is game concept > cannot support meta sounds,

# Mixing Sound

## Old
Use sound classes hierarhy for sound mixing- logical mixing
need clasification of types. - Treee can get supercomples
#####   Sound Class
can use to group multiple sounds together, can add submix

##### Submixes

## Parameter Modulation  (NEW)
4.26- matrix insterd of tree, u can create buses.

This expands the power for sound designers to control audio in games, and allows the UE4 audio engine to modulate and control any audio parameter using a number of methods.

https://youtu.be/BV5l_7-w7cg


`Control Bus` - like single fader  (FOR EVERY CONTROLABLE LAYER)
  - add parameter data  - (i.e. volume)
  - override adress (i.e hook to midi)
  - add generator - automaticly modulate (i.e. modulate)
`Control Bus MIX snap` -  of scallars taht affect *(Default ?  put here control buses (those above )
  - can add `controll bus`    
`Modulation Generator` - modulate stuff lik eLFO
`Modulation Parameter` -  
  - different types  ie volume
`Parameter Patch` - complex patch

------------


## Submix

- occur after distance attenuation and spatialization.
Sounds within a Sound Class can be sent to a Submix, which allows multiple sound types to be processed with submix effects at once.

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/submix.png">


mix of individual sources. place where mixing hapen into a single buffer.    (u can put audio fx on submixes )




**Submix Effect** presets



<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/submixfxp.png">


place where mixing sound and u can add sound fx .  


<img  src="/src/ue/audio/submixeffect.png"  width="200" >

.

**Submix Effect Chain**  - to chain effects





------------


##  Source Effects

- pre-distance attenuation and pre-spatialization.

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/srcfx.png">

Audio effect which applies (a filter, a delay, an envelope, distortion,  ... )  to a single source ( SoundWave, a SoundCue, a Synth,)

<img  src="/src/ue/audio/srceffect.png"  width="200" >

.

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/srcfxchain.png" >

**Source Effect Chain** - Add `Source Effect Preset` to chain. wich u can add to: SoundWaves, Cues, or components

`Set Bypass Source Effect Chain Entry ` -  

**An Envelope Follower & listener** - is Old or new @synersdthesia?

# Analyzing Output
Toolset for audio analyses.
(??? source tree for the Envelope follower so that I can pull them into a new project and use them as an integration starting point.)

## Live synthesis
- `Start Analyzing Output` - live for submix >> `Get Magnitude for Frequencies`
Audio analysis live. (from Niagara [there is BP somewhere...]) ???   

## Cooked FFT Data
- `Get Cooked FFT Data` -Baked Spectral Analysis 4.22 new -  must enable in file FFT  https://www.artstation.com/blogs/chriszuko/20gO/using-ue4s-422-new-baked-spectral-analysis

## Synesthesia
- `Constant QA` / `Loudness` / `OnSet`   - use NRT files  > get playback percent  > get at time (qnrt) < for one file



### NRT
<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/nrt.png">
Links the analysis algorithm settings to the sound wave being analyzed.
- Audio Synesthesia NRT—An analyzer that supports non-real-time (NRT) analysis of a USoundWave.
- Audio Synesthesia NRT Settings—The settings for the Audio Synesthesia NRT that you can use to change settings from the default values.
Maintains the results of analysis as a uasset.     
Provides Blueprint function access to the results.     

#### ConstantQ
  higher quality (hi and low like spectrum fft) double frequencies is exponential
 growth so to visualize spectrum we must convert this log to human mapping.  

`Get Normalized Channel Constant Q At Time`    

##### Perceptual loudness
 (bit dif than envelope) take in amount  

 `Get Loudness At a Time`  

#####  On sets
 loudness and changing in loud  

 `Get Channel Onset between Times`

# Quant Events

## Quartz
Quartz clock - synchronization mechanism  (line up to beat or bar)

Retriger sound every time loop begins. to be sure
subsystem that handle and allow acces and recive dleegats from clocks (can multiple)

- timesync is old version

[Quartz Docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/WorkingWithAudio/Quartz/)

- **[Create new clock]**
name
settings: quantization settings > time signature
 - 4/4
 - puls ovveride  / for odd metters 7/8 6/8 ....

##### [Get handle for clock]


##### [Set Beat Per Minute]
- set BPM

quntisation boundry


#####  [Set Tick Per Second]
Htz


### **[Play Quantized]**
- delegate
on audio component it can be any specialized sound that play on audio component. np source buzz, sound que, sound wave.  

quantizet playback on specialized sounds on the world


##### Time signature
for musical timing
[Make QuartzTimeSignature] > [Quartz Clock settings]




framerate and callback freq
update rat must be smaller (callboacks in buffering syst )



#### BP
  - `fade out`
  - `play sound`
  - `play sound at location`
  - `re-triggers`




  ---

## Concurrency Management
  - limit same sound sources

---


# Sound fields
Encoding audio into in 3d space. Can use for source orientation lock ambience within word
`Ambisonic` is trying to represent sound with sound pressure around audoiopsphere. can be decoded with any speaker config.  not depend of speakers


import `ambix` file (but still .wav) but still can have 4 or more channels.  There are special tools to author them.

order:  
- 1 order relatively cheap but only for overall localisation
- higher order specific location

HOW TO
1. checkbox in wave that is ambisonic.
2. Enable spatialisation
3. in blueprint can set rotation of actor to infl. rot sound. https://youtu.be/wux2TZHwmck?t=5915

---

# Convolution reverb
A convolution filter.  (work on Impulse response. which u can record)  
Can simulate reverb or use recorded.


HOW TO:
0. record impulse wave
1. `RMB` on wave file: create impulse response  (settings: can set here premixing volume)
2. create new  `Submix Effect presets` of type: `submix convolution reverb presets` (settings:  reference impulse)
3. create `custom attenuation` > (settings:  `attenuation submix send` >> add list >> add submix as destination of send

# Modular Synth (component)


Modular Subtractive Synthesizer

Audio buses

`Note On` - Note 0-127 , velocity, duration


##### Synth bank

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/synthbank.png">
<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/synthwavbank.png">

You can store synths patches and samples in banks:   

`Set Synth Presset` - (synth ref>get from array> break> synthpresste)

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/synthclip.png">

**Synth Clips** - ??

---

# Granular Synth (component)

Wave player playing (usually) small pieces of the file (called grains)   Each grain can have its own settings, so in this way, it’s possible to play back dozens or even hundreds of audio grains from a single file all with different parameters.


------

  - `send fx` - are those who work only on part of eg: send in a fn of distance (reverbm delay)
  - `bin` : quantize a spectrum to buckets cause cannot have continuous data
  - `stem` : segment of music  you can split audio to different layers of music
  - Virtualization - play when silent. (reserve voice so expensiveDefault condition - when out of source sound will stop !!!!
