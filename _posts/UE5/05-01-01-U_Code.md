# Unreal
## Prepper environment
- Download from `site` (can add not editable code)
- Download from GitHub - with source code.
    - add `github` name to unreal
    - add associations
    - can use `gamesync` - project management (must build it)

### Folder structure
Folder for share project: `Config`, `Content`, `Source`, `.uproject`  
eventually `binaries`  

Config hierarchy - can override default engines (all
project settings)
1. `engine/config`  - .ini  base editor settings
2. `engine/*platformfolders*/config` - .ini
3. `project/config` - Default*.ini
4. `project/*platformfolders*/config` - .ini
5. `project/saved/*platformfolders*/config` - .ini
- `intermediate` - compilable can delete  - not sybnced
- `project/bin:`
   - build mosules with pdb  files with debug symbols
   - exec compiled by bylid tool
- `engine/binaries/DontNET/` - swarm
- `engine/binaries/Win64/` - exe
- `engine/plugins`
- `.uproject` - engine association and information about modules and plugins


-----------

# Build



#### Unreal Build tool
Generate project files.
- `Native project`: engine in same root as project let asociate proj&engine
- compile from `IDE ()` or unreal `editor` itself. or `unreal game sync` or `live ++`

1. if contain C++ code you must build your binaries first.  
   - target : - editor client ...
   - state : - debug includ symbols


#### Unreal automation tool
If u want to pack

1. cookig - optimised files per platform
  -  cook by the book
  - cook on the fly - cook will skip (increas loading but faster itters)
2. staging - copies  
3. packing (save coocked)
4. Run...
5. Gauntlet - automation tests.

#Engine loop

### Loading

- main fn (launchWindows.cpp)
  - engine loop. (base gameplay loop)       
     - 1 pre init - most modules loaded    
     - 2 init - start obj itself / player viewport and associate with game instance
       - rest of init is in: load map call:
     - 3 tick

# Engine structure
- **Source Code** - Source code in C++.
- **Modules** - collection of classes. All compiled to single .dll (like plugins)
- **Macros** - expose fn  from code to BP and editor. Metadata, fn for BP. Networking, serialisation ec...   `uClass`, `uStruct`,` uEnum`, `uProperty`
- **Core features**
  - Basic  
   - numbers: - `Float`/ `Double`  `(U)Int8/16/32/64`  (use explic integers. good habbit )
   - `Enum` - file - can use as variable is just a list!
   - `Structure` - clases but only for: plane data - file canc combine and conatain differnt types of data (like transform is loc, rot, scale)
   - `fString` - basic (mutable) / `fName` (global maps, super fast comp, case insenst - for names and paths) / `fText` - localized
   - `TSet` - No keys! only list of  values / `TArray` - Array of values / `TMap` - contain values and keys (if key same will replace )
   - `FVector` / `FRotator` / `FQuat`
   - `uObject` - low level memory managed
   - `Actor` - can be placed on level.
     - components - add to parent actor - can attach to all of classes
        - uActorComponent - dont have transform in world
        - UvvSceneComponent - have relative to parent Actor.
  - smart pointers:
  - Interfaces - better create in c++
  - static fn.
  - `Data Assets` / `Data tables` / `Curves` /
  - delegates & events -
  - subsystem - keep modular code
  - async task graph
- **Memory**
 - load with map or from soft ref. Are unladed by garbage collector when nothing them anymore or are pending to kill
 - ! All asset with hard ref are loaded with them !  - don't ref to many things and use soft ref !
 - Garbage collection. Mark and sweep - fast multithreaded
- **Replication**
  - Network up to 100 players

#### Gameplay Framework

In object oriented design everything is hierarchical.

- **UObject** - main class in c++ used by engine   
 - **AActor** - subclas s of UObject. can be spawn on scene   
   - **APawn** - subclas of Actor - can be posesed   
     - **ADefaultPawn** -
     - **ACharacter** - subclass of Pawn - for antropomorphic figures like human   
   - x


- **Game Mode** - Rules of the game.  What to spawn, first thing to create. Define rules of session in multi.  Not good for storing persistent data.
- **Game Instance** - For persistent data - can access anywhere
- **Game State** - State of game which may replicate to all players
- **Pawn**  - How character move, looks, interacts
  - set `DefaultPawnClass` in game mode constructor or, override `AGameModeBase::FetDefaultPawnClassForController`
- **Character** specialize pawn with:
  - capsule
  - character movement connected to: ch class
  - skeletal mesh
  - able of sync *(replication) / path find / root motion from anim playback
- **Player State**  - Contains data relevant to the player's standing in the game, how the player is represented to others (names, score)
set `PlayerStateClass` in game mode constructor or, override `AController::InitPlayerState`
- **Player/AI Controller** - Server-authoritative data and local state relevant to the owning player only. input, UI
set `PlayerControllerClass` in game mode constructor or override `AGameModeBase::SpawnPlayerController`


- **Input Component** / Enchance input is newer
- **Movement Component** - pawn, vechicle...
- Cheat management
- Ticks
- Mass
- Game Features Plugins - can @ runtime. It can extend.



# Data management

Q:
- where to keep / edit data
- what for cook
- scalability is available ?
- versioning / saves / trans languages
- validation. Earlier better
- loading. Can break into parts.


- **Vanilla BP** - easy validation, bulk edit visa property matrix - use soft asset ref for asset u are not actively use
- **Data asset** - u need to open editor to edit ??? can have data in single asset
- **Data table** - (should be master) load all at once - better way to work in one place / csv/ json ? - or data tabl e - who have ability
- **Data Register** - new. similar to composite data tables for multiple people working.
- **Curves** -

#### Dependences

Loading assets chain have huge performance implications
cant brak in to parts because everything is connected. Sometimes can run ou of memory.

- cast on a type can create hard ref on this type. Check - Asset manager


Debug:
- Run 'Size Map' on asset

Dont mix logic and assets !
