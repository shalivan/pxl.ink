# Attitude

## Approach

- Find most interesting question that u are barley can answer.
- Don't save on means. Hardware and tools defining your way.   
- Make notes (with possible solutions).
- Even bad ideas can have nice execution


## Mindset

- `Don't make excuses`.   
- `Understanding` Understand medium
- `Strong visual library` Help with finding patterns.
- `Practice` - training is most efficient way to have progress
- `Perseverance`. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- `Habits` help to free mind of thinking about basics. Rhythm have benefits
- `Control attention span`. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.
- `Knowledge` cultural, anatomy light, help with understanding to know what you want.
- if you want be better you must accumulate lot of training data to cancel wrong data, and you must pinpoint attention on things you want to improve so you can reinforce it.
- Reasoning  changes immediately with results, and doing next steps
- Protect time and space  you work
- hazards of "self-consciousness" when considering the key factors influencing a design.

## Planning  

   - Check `anchors`  and `constraints` to work within restrictions.   
   - Identify possible `obstacles` that can interrupt or slow you down.
   - Use `limitations as strengths`.
    - Make it `simple`, optimize.(simple rule > complicated behavior).  (keep things simple complex)
   - Work on main issues and resolve `core problems`.  
   - Break `complex problems` into pieces. If u can quantify u can overcome it.
   - `Pipelines` - to make data and information flow through easy and prevent bottlenecks.
   - `Automate` processes. Keep things `procedural` as long you can for quick fixes.
   - `tools` to organize automate make easier
   - Have `crumple zone` to be able to reduce scope.
   - `R'n'D` - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  
   - Quid pro quo `time vs detail` precision and nuance creates fidelity
   - Development means `Iterations`
   - Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to

######   Communications Medium as Process loop




Culture > Laws > Economy > User Experience > App Code > OS Code > Hardware & Tech Architecture

Hardware & Tech Architecture:  
Emerging Tech Provides New Affordances >     
Creators Explore New Affordances >  
Distributors Provide Channels For Audiences to Access New Work >  
Audience learn grow to watch new work & Provide feedback >
