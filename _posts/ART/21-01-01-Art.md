# Attitude

## Approach

- Find most interesting question that u are barley can answer.
- Don't save on means. Hardware and tools defining your way.   
- Make notes (with possible solutions).
- Even bad ideas can have nice execution


## Mindset

- `Don't make excuses`.   
- `Understanding` Understand medium
- `Strong visual library` Help with finding patterns.
- `Practice` - training is most efficient way to have progress
- `Perseverance`. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- `Habits` help to free mind of thinking about basics. Rhythm have benefits
- `Control attention span`. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.
- `Knowledge` cultural, anatomy light, help with understanding to know what you want.
- if you want be better you must accumulate lot of training data to cancel wrong data, and you must pinpoint attention on things you want to improve so you can reinforce it.
- Reasoning  changes immediately with results, and doing next steps
- Protect time and space  you work
- hazards of "self-consciousness" when considering the key factors influencing a design.

## Planning  

   - Check `anchors`  and `constraints` to work within restrictions.   
   - Identify possible `obstacles` that can interrupt or slow you down.
   - Use `limitations as strengths`.
    - Make it `simple`, optimize.(simple rule > complicated behavior).  (keep things simple complex)
   - Work on main issues and resolve `core problems`.  
   - Break `complex problems` into pieces. If u can quantify u can overcome it.
   - `Pipelines` - to make data and information flow through easy and prevent bottlenecks.
   - `Automate` processes. Keep things `procedural` as long you can for quick fixes.
   - `tools` to organize automate make easier
   - Have `crumple zone` to be able to reduce scope.
   - `R'n'D` - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  
   - Quid pro quo `time vs detail` precision and nuance creates fidelity
   - Development means `Iterations`
   - Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to

(Form + Function + Content) < Context < Critical Approach

# Conception

Concept is communication form. Can help in further development if references are insufficient. Can be in various forms, sketch of design

- Exploration: `variations` and `iterations` (make 3 options and hybridize  based on feedback) Options, not variations. Variations are for finished concept.
- Concept should be usable
- Form perspective to be able `to translate` directly to 3d
- Draw additional `side views` and important elements.
- Don't limit yourself. Use 3d, textures, kit bash, references, photo bash


## Scale
  - `proportions` are critical. If sth to thick > like a toy can change perception!  
  - Refer to `human scale` and show `relations` with other objects     
  - lot of fog make enviro bigger

## Silhouettes

[Graphic Design](/graphicdesign/)

```
Engeniging vs design (human centric)prototypes  
design thinking is methodology   
engeniers check if it work correctly  
prototypes - ask question expose asumptions and sneek to the future
```

# Composition


## Subject matter
Have a Subject Matter

- `Focal point`, composition lines (but its not true that they lead eye (physically) its not literally its only specializing abstract concept ). If character in scene, focal point is where is head or where he look.


## Dynamism
Dynamic vs static  
- dynamism: moment just `before action`, `during`, `after`
- Visual flow `Lateral Updraft`, `Bouncing`, `Stuck in vortex`, `Swipe and repeat`, `Chutes n ladders`, `Splitting atom`

## Harmony vs Chaos

## Point Of View


##### Position
  - human camera. Eye level, or below.
  - horizon on the shot

##### Perspective      
FOV
games 60 ,
concept art design 90-120 FOV (;ems 35 or smaller up to 8) (to show more even in small spaces )
Console optimized for tv far away
Pc FOV higher because is closer to eyes



## Framing
- **Depth**  mid : subject matter, back : context
- **Edges**
     - Occur in: `Object`, `Plane` or `Color`  
     - Types:  `Hard`, `Soft`, `Lost`
     - Avoid: (tangents) `Hidden`, `Skimmed`, `Fused`, `Stolen`
- **Crop**
     - can be indicated by shadow,
     - character can bye cropped by item
     - by edge of canvas
- **Rule of 3rd**  
- **Golden ratio** `sectio aurea` a+b/a = 1.618 φ  - golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ

# Draw

- Practice one line not multiple in same place
- relax arm, let lines flow  
- Flip  for perspective correction   
- Thumbnails for detail correction   
- B&W for valor correction  

###  Line drawing

`Line weight` (thickness):
- areas of shadow
- areas of form overlap
- corners creases like ao
- area with weight  (usually bottom)
- On focal point (where u should look)
- Detail Control: Most details on: Focal point / silhouettes

`Contour lines` indicate forms. (across form) give dimension. Like a directional texture on object. overlap lines to add more 3d, avoid paralel lines (flat )
`Fill` with light gray marker Build slowly  
`Highlights` - Paper not always white 100% so you can add little bit of   with white paint.

# Paint


- start with big forms then refine
- basics: dark mid light/ fore mid back-ground   

- darks are easy to get drker and light to get lighter so left some contrast to refine and add during process
- softer gradiend and sharper, crisper places  


## Value
color change in light conditions.  (Green is in middle so it can change even more) so take care about value first.

- **Light values** - more light > more contrast > brain faster recognize in perfect conditions we have balance because of eye adaptation.
- **Atmosphere changed value** and add depth  (far less contrast and lighten , near local value and darker)
- **Local values** - Different materials have local values  cause of color.
but you need to have harmony in values to  communicate forms. if good and clear local values  you can read nicely even in flat lighting

# Value of culture
Mental real estate ideas burned in your mind like mickey mouse  
Culture is spirit of society
