# Attitude

## Approach

- Find the most interesting question that you can barely answer.
- Don't save on means. Hardware and tools defining your way.  
- Make notes (with possible solutions).
- Even bad ideas can have nice execution
- “Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.” Picasso


## Mindset

- `Don't make excuses`.  
- `Understanding` Understand medium
- `Strong visual library` Help with finding patterns.
- `Practice` - training is the most efficient way to have progress
- `Perseverance`. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- `Habits` help to free your mind of thinking about basics. Rhythms have benefits
- `Control attention span`. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.
- `Knowledge` , culture, anatomy, light, help with understanding to know what you want.
- if you want to be better you must accumulate a lot of training data to cancel wrong data, and you must pinpoint attention on things you want to improve so you can reinforce it.
- Reasoning  changes immediately with results, and doing next steps
- Protect time and space  you work
- hazards of "self-consciousness" when considering the key factors influencing a design.
- look at  big picture to see if major story points are clear


## Planning  
- Whats the focus of the image
- Check `anchors`  and `constraints` to work within restrictions.  
- Identify possible `obstacles` that can interrupt or slow you down.
- Use `limitations as strengths`.
- Make it `simple`, optimize.(simple rule > complicated behavior).  (keep things simple and complex)
- Work on main issues and resolve `core problems`.  
- Break `complex problems` into pieces. If u can quantify u can overcome it.
- `Pipelines` - to make data and information flow through easily and prevent bottlenecks.
- `Automate` processes. Keep things `procedural` as long as you can for quick fixes.
- `tools` to organize and automate make it easier
- Have a `crumple zone` to be able to reduce scope.
- `R'n'D` - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  
- Quid pro quo `time vs detail` precision and nuance creates fidelity
- Development means `Iterations`
- Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to
- easy part is doing, hard part is planning.

Function over Form  - EASIER - (have silhouette / bbox and add details )
Form over Function - HARDER - create new form from rules of how sth should work.

Animation

- dynamic animation - pet, ...

######   Communications Medium as Process loop




Culture > Laws > Economy > User Experience > App Code > OS Code > Hardware & Tech Architecture

Hardware & Tech Architecture:  
Emerging Tech Provides New Affordances >     
Creators Explore New Affordances >  
Distributors Provide Channels For Audiences to Access New Work >  
Audience learn grow to watch new work & Provide feedback >
