Animalistic features. Design base on anture or manufactured items

# UX/UI

- Consistency / Intentionallyty
- Ergonomy. The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- Visual Feedback
- Simplicity / Cognitive Load. (The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.)

**UI types**:
- non-Diagetic,
- Diagetic,
- Spatial,
- Meta

## Props
  - elements should be `grounded` in scene  
  - barnackling ssmall things around,
 - footing - awarenes of  intersecting,
 - greebling materialing








 ----



## Riging
   - `namespaces`  


## Animation
   - `Keyframe`, `reactive`, `dynamic` simulations, `mocap data`
   - Timing FPS
   - Easing curves  
   - Reaction time 0.2 for see 0.1 for hear and less for touch (go / no go time decision)

## Simulation & procedural   
   - Normalize - Fit parameters to 0-1  

#### Cloths
   - Tailoring (amount of material)   
   - Material properties >  (stretch, bend, weight)    
   - Grain of fabric. (weakness of cross cuts)

### Cinematography
https://chrisbrejon.com/cg-cinematography/appendix-1-guerilla-render-in-production/

#### Camera  
   - Depth, Framing, Cropping, FOV
   - Avoid unnecessary moves, unwanted obj cutouts.   
   - `Depth of Field` `Grain` `Bloom`



#### Editing
   - J cut - sound precedes the cut  - smooth scene introduction
   - B-Roll - video footage that sets the scene, reveals details, or generally enhances the story
   - Eye Trace - being aware of where the audience's eyes are looking
   - 180 axes of action indicate on the screen
   - 45 Degrees at least when 2 cuts showing same obj
   - Itâ€™s easy to cut between close and wide angles
   - Cut on Motion / Cut on Similar Elements



   # TRAILKER :: (przeniesc do PR )

   - visual feadback  (hjow easy is to see change and understand)
   - camera distance
   - number of objects
   - audience familiarity with subject. or required knowledge
   more filmmakeing than gameplaying .
   Direction / cammera / puppeetieer
   - you can eye trace for shot cuts: u dont have to move your ewyes to much
   - are u capture as player or 3rd person
   - movement can be character
   - speed of camera tells a lot  character
   - controllers are best for slow movements
   - use metronome when playing to the music
   - intentionality of shots

   - use not only
   Composition
   Redability
   Preformancve



#### Procedurals
>procedural ;
- scalability
- prone to human error

- tiles (procedurally generate world)
- L-system
- tracery and templating text (combining text)
- distribution (hierarchy and clustering and maintain spacing)
- parametric ()
- interpretive: noise Perlin, grid/cell (voronoi/delaunay), metaballs
