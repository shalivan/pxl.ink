# Architecture

Arch as response to anchors:  needs / function / context / local constrain /  external conditions  (sun: south wall is most efficient, land features)


# Form
Point of contact between mass and space

- forms, (space, structure) , outward expression. (size scale texture ) emotions (formal language create forms)
- shapes (l- shelter and open , long sides... )

|--|--|
![](/Sources/Arch/add.png)  | Additive | picturesque, full of movement,
![](/Sources/Arch/sub.png)  |Subtractive   | generous, When regular form mising volume peart but retain identity




#### Imposible Figure
M.C. Escher


# Space
 Space is formed by relationship to object within. Literal space define scene by Degree of enclosure.

 |  |  |Enclosure Spaces|
 |--|--| --|
 ![](/Sources/Arch/floor.png) | Floor | topology / architecture Man made / natural, Unmodulated / Modulated, Ground stability, Balcony
 ![](/Sources/Arch/columns.png) |Columns | Obelisk, Column (europeans order), Pier, Pilaster. (Rhythm > directionality) (forming subspaces, fasades)
 ![](/Sources/Arch/wall.png) |Walls |
 ![](/Sources/Arch/door.png) |Doors | Point of acces, Treshold, Guide to movement- determin the rdirection and scheme of circulation within room
 ![](/Sources/Arch/windows.png) |Windows | Air, Light, View, modulation of facade, as scaling element
 ![](/Sources/Arch/stairs.png) |Staircase | As step, As seat, Physical link, Storage, Escalator Ladder Ramp Elevator Straight Spiral Staiecase.  
 ![](/Sources/Arch/roof.png) |Roofs | Spatial Enclosure, Volume modulator. Folded, Curved, Membrane, Frame

Veranda, Terrace, Patio, Potch, Goyer, Lobby, Vestibule, Antresola, Balcony, Portico, Anteroom, Gallery


#### Implied  Space

| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/Sources/Arch/implied2.png) |Implied|When elements or spaces are not explicit but are nonetheless apparent. Perspective in 2d is implied

- implied by shadow (shadow space )
- half-roofing
- platform Schodki (sugerowana),
- open colonnade   

#### Negative Space


| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/Sources/Arch/court.png) |Negative | Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s)




- court
- horizon height- separation and connections



## Spatial Form

##### Organization
is both the physical and material solid-stuff of the built environment and its void-space. It is meant to capture the relationship between solid form and void-form

- **Plane Layout** - indoor, outdoor, connection
- **Pace** - change frequency over time by density over sopace (close spaceing make illusion of fast movement) Repetiton and Rythm


| | |
|--|--|
Centralized  
Linear |(corridor with rooms)
Radial | Panopticon (round prison)
Clustered | Hub
Grid | Organization
Asymetry | Irregular




##### Relationship



Space-space relations

| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/Sources/Arch/within.png) | Space within other space|
![](/Sources/Arch/inter.png) | Interlocking  |(shared by 2 spaces)
![](/Sources/Arch/edge.png)  |Edge / Face contact |
![](/Sources/Arch/corridor2.png) | Links | corridors
![](/Sources/Arch/spatial.png)  |Spatial tension|

Building - ground/horizon relation

# Composition

- Rule of 3rd  
- `sectio aurea` a+b/a = 1.618 φ  - golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ  
- Edges Can be  `Hard`, `Soft`, `Lost`
- Edge Avoid:   (tangents) `Hidden`, `Skimmed`, `Fused`, `Stolen`
- `Edges` change in `Object`, `Plane` or `Color`  
- Depth
- Focal point, composition lines (but its not true that they lead eye (physically) its not literally its only specializing abstract concept )
- Cropped things: can be indicated by shadow, character can bye cropped by item

Harmony and disonance - duality

### Some ways of wisual flow

Lateral Updraft
bouncing
stuck in vortex
swipe and repeat
chutes n ladders
spliting attom

# Draw

## Sketch
- Refer to `human scale` and `relations` with other objects    
- `proportion`, `shape recognition`, `perspective`  

- practice one line not multiple in same place

  line drawings






## Paint   
  - Value !!
  - Biggest to smallest details
  - Detail Control: Most details on: Focal point / silhouettes
  - Stylization  
    - [Flip  for perspective correction]   
    - [Thumbnails for detail correction]    
    - [B&W for valor correction]    

- dynamism / >!>!>>!>!!??!?!
- moment (just before action / during / after )

# Color
   - `The Opponent-Process Theory`, `Trichromatic Theory`  
   - Color temperature  vs  neutral colors (W&B and gray)   
   - Work in `HSV` to manage `Chroma` and `Valor` .   

**HSV**   
- Hue - perceived colors. dependent on its dominant wavelength and independent of intensity or lightness.
- Saturation (Chroma) - the strength or dominance of the hue.  
- Lightness (Valor) -  or darkness of the hue.

**Compose Colors**

   || |
   |-|- |
   `Monochrome` | 1 color
   `Analogous`| Similar
   `Complimentary` | Opposites
   `Split-Complementary` | (dominant & support + accent),
   `Triad`  |3 |
   `Tetradic` | 4   


   - `Spectral Locus` ploting all visible colors can show how much sRGB is limited. rec2020 (much vider color space)      
   Enviroment make diference how we see image  (monitor clalib and viewing conditions)  

#### Contrast   
- `Value` high key painting has a `high-value` scale (light) vs `low-value` scale (dark).  
- `Hue/Saturation`  
- `Edge`  
- `Proximity`  
- `Texture` (material), `Shape`

## Character
   - layers: `skeletal`, `muscle`, `fat`, `skin`  
   - proportions  
   - character  

face, eyes, hads,

#### Paint Skin
   - `sun damage`, `blue veins face / forehead`, `petechiae / freckles`, `wrinkles / ance`

## Sculpt Model
   - `silhouettes` > `Medium Frequencies` > `Detail`      
   - Varies details placement.     
   - Sculpt across the form (not with the flow).    
   - Don't use smooth.       
   - Directionality  
   - Maintain Volume

#### Geometry
   - Procedural hard surface: crees
   - Procedural organic: Build geo from curves and points. use procedural for detail (VDB)  

#### Low poly:
   - High fidelity in silhouette defining places

#### Uv's:
   - Consistent texel
   - Orient uv - for brushing, directional mask
   - Bake per part /material ID / separate parts with alphas  

---

## Props
  - elements should be `grounded` in scene  
  - barnackling ssmall things around,
 - footing - awarenes of  intersecting,
 - greebling materialing



## Scene Setup   
   - `Sky box` > `Exp fog` > `Sky Light` > `Directional Light` > `Secondary lights` > `Cam Post` > `Color Grading`
 - `Depth`  - Atmosphere, Repeating same elements in space
- `Light` - but we not evolve to going directly to light

## Riging
   - `namespaces`  


## Animation
   - `Keyframe`, `reactive`, `dynamic` simulations, `mocap data`
   - Timing FPS
   - Easing curves  
   - Reaction time 0.2 for see 0.1 for hear and less for touch (go / no go time decision)


   ---


## Simulation & procedural   
   - Normalize - Fit parameters to 0-1  

#### Cloths
   - Tailoring (amount of material)   
   - Material properties >  (stretch, bend, weight)    
   - Grain of fabric. (weakness of cross cuts)  



#### Light
   - Unmotivated Light - Support light that doesn't have a physical representation.  
   - `Direct`: `Key light`, `Fill light`, `Rim light`,   `Diffuse light`
   -`Indirect`: `Ambient`, `Bounced`  
   - one eye must be stronger

### Cinematography
https://chrisbrejon.com/cg-cinematography/appendix-1-guerilla-render-in-production/

#### Camera  
   - Depth, Framing, Cropping, FOV
   - Avoid unnecessary moves, unwanted obj cutouts.   
   - `Depth of Field` `Grain` `Bloom`



#### Editing
   - J cut - sound precedes the cut  - smooth scene introduction
   - B-Roll - video footage that sets the scene, reveals details, or generally enhances the story
   - Eye Trace - being aware of where the audience's eyes are looking
   - 180 axes of action indicate on the screen
   - 45 Degrees at least when 2 cuts showing same obj
   - It’s easy to cut between close and wide angles
   - Cut on Motion / Cut on Similar Elements



   # TRAILKER :: (przeniesc do PR )

   - visual feadback  (hjow easy is to see change and understand)
   - camera distance
   - number of objects
   - audience familiarity with subject. or required knowledge
   more filmmakeing than gameplaying .
   Direction / cammera / puppeetieer
   - you can eye trace for shot cuts: u dont have to move your ewyes to much
   - are u capture as player or 3rd person
   - movement can be character
   - speed of camera tells a lot  character
   - controllers are best for slow movements
   - use metronome when playing to the music
   - intentionality of shots

   - use not only
   Composition
   Redability
   Preformancve



#### Procedurals
>procedural ;
- scalability
- prone to human error

- tiles (procedurally generate world)
- L-system
- tracery and templating text (combining text)
- distribution (hierarchy and clustering and maintain spacing)
- parametric ()
- interpretive: noise Perlin, grid/cell (voronoi/delaunay), metaballs
