# Lore

The backstory created around a fictional universe.Believable and convincing settings
- Rules for world for all characters same

###### Holon
holon represents a way to overcome the dichotomy between parts and wholes, Koestler's Holon Simultaneously Whole & Part:


# Pace
**Pacing**, **Build up** Stimulus delta over moments. Surprise changes moment to moment and our desire.
Every world is holistic system At multiple scales (Consistency  Believability)


###   World scale
- `Self`/`Individual`, `Family`, `Community`, `Others` (City), `World`, `Cosmos`  
- Levels of Organization of the Human Organism - `Organism` > `Organs` > `Tissues` > `Vells` > `Organellas` > `Molecules` > `Atoms`



### Pace layers
- make story on various level of magnification
6 layers that function simultaneously at different speeds within society by Stuart Brand  and (architect Frank Duffy)


|Years | Stuart Brand layer | Function | Frank Duffy | Bourdieu|
| - | - | - | - | - |
0|Fashion, Art | Innovate (New Ideas, competitive) | Stuff (Sets changes)| Events
5|Commerce | Differentiation (better ideas, unique process)| Space Plan (Furniture changes)|
15|Infrastructure | Record (slow, incremental, preservation, efficiency, common ideas) | Service (pipes and maintenance )| Economic / Society
70|Governance | | Skin, (human)|
100|Culture |  | Structure (building )|
forever | Nature |  | Site (place, )| Environment

- 10 years - credit cycle - crisis    
- 100 years - world power cycle: reserve currencies    
- 1000 years - governance of humanity cycle: `Tribes`  > `Religions` > `Kingdoms` > `Governance`

||||
| - | - | - |
Fast | Discontinues | absorb shock, learn, innovation, revolution | Has all the attention
Slow| continuous, integrate shock, constraint, consistency | Has all the power
