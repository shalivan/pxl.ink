# Lore

The backstory created around a fictional universe. Believable and convincing settings. Should intertwine with design and gameplay [zalozenia]. **Holon** represents a way to overcome the dichotomy between parts and wholes, Koestler's Holon Simultaneously Whole & Part.
- Multiple co-existing rules.
- Rules for all characters muste be same.
- Gaps in world allowed players to participate in it existance. With details ambiguous people will fill them themself, > curiosity.




# Pace

## Pace layers
Make story on various level of magnification
Every world is holistic system At multiple scales (Consistency  Believability)

#### Peace size scale
- Human world: `Self`/`Individual (character)`, `Family (Home, environment)`, `Community`, `Others (Citizens)`, `World`, `Cosmos`  
- Human organism: `Organism` > `Organs` > `Tissues` > `Vells` > `Organelles` > `Molecules` > `Atoms`


#### Paces time scales
Pace scales by _Stuart Brand  and (architect Frank Duffy)_ - Six layers that function simultaneously at different speeds within society

|Years | Stuart Brand layer | Function | Frank Duffy | Bourdieu|
| - | - | - | - | - |
0|Fashion, Art | Innovate (New Ideas, competitive) | Stuff (Sets changes)| Events
5|Commerce | Differentiation (better ideas, unique process)| Space Plan (Furniture changes)|
15|Infrastructure | Record (slow, incremental, preservation, efficiency, common ideas) | Service (pipes and maintenance )| Economic / Society
70|Governance | | Skin, (human)|
100|Culture |  | Structure (building )|
forever | Nature |  | Site (place, )| Environment

**Economy cycle**
- 10 years - credit cycle - crisis    
- 100 years - world power cycle: reserve currencies `1450 Portugal` > `1530 Spain` > `1640 nith` > `1720 Fr` > `1815 GB` > `1944 US` > `crypto`
- 1000 years - governance of humanity cycle: `Tribes`  > `Religions` > `Kingdoms` > `Governance`

######  Speed of change

|||||
| - | - | - | - |
Fast | Discontinues | absorb shock, learn, innovation, revolution | Has all the attention
Slow| Continuous | integrate shock, constraint, consistency | Has all the power



# Structures


- **Structure** - Matter
- **Information** - Genetics
- **Energy** - Metabolism

#####  Pathetic Dot Theory
 _Lawrence Lessig_ It discusses how lives of individuals (the pathetic dots in question) are regulated by four forces:
- **Law** - threatens sanction if it is not obeyed.
- **Market** - supply and demand
- **existing conditions**- Technology,m biology, geography, technology and others constrain our actions.
- **Cultural Norms** - enforced by the community


#####  lex McDowells Mandala

- Disruption - what if   
- Context - where   
- Ecologies - social/ mental / physical urban planinag   
- Domains / sub - transtpot system / fasion / technologies    

.
- system   
- location   
- maker   
- body   
- culture   

.
- **Self** (culture, history)
- **Body** (structure terrain)  
- **Mind** (Governance > economic)
- **Fuel** (Energy> Resources)



##### G.R.A.P.E.S.
- **Geography**
- **Religion**
- **Achievements**
- **Politics**
- **Economy**
- **Social**



# Geography


Condition and adaptation to explore and source energy.

## Eco systems    
- plants > get energy from sun  > bugs eat plants  > lizard eat bugs.   
- find niche and adapt.  shifting landscape of available niches and adaptations that find opportunities. (evolutionary pathway)  
- simple systems have problem with less potential of emergence   


**Weather**  
- impact of weather â€¦

**Terrain**   

## Resources
- export/ import
- natural resources
- chance of survival

## Predation


# Civilizations

- Agriculture
- Hunter Gatherers
- Self-sufficient / synthetic

`Settlers` > `Conquest` > `Trade` > `Prosperity` > `Reason` > `Collapse`


## Technology advancement



###Revolutions
Revolutions: society to economy and geo posic
- Fire (up to 400,000)
- **Agriculture** - wooden plow, new horse-drawn threshers, grain and grass cutters, cultivators, rakes, and the labor-saving corn shellers
- **Metallurgy** (3300 BC) bronze / (1200 B.C) iron
- **Transport** (deep water navigation)
- Thermodynamic - **industrial** (steam engine)
- Electricity - (dynamo, generators)
- Assembly line
- Transistors - **digital** revolution (calculation) late 20th
- Internet / AI - (information)
- Molecular  fusion / quantum comp  / atomic lvl - brain net  

### Industrial Revolutions

|.| | |
|---|---|---|
Primitive |
Mechanization | Machinery |Steam  engine  Urbanization
Electrification | Wires | Steel, Electricity, Combustion engine, Transport
Automation || Computer, Internet, Globalization
Digitalization || Blockchain, Machine Learning,

## Science


`science` > `engineering` > `building`  

######  Loop Innovation
 Communications Medium as Process loop  
`Culture` > `Laws` > `Economy` > `User Experience` > `App Code` > `OS Code` > `Hardware` & `Tech Architecture`

Hardware & Tech Architecture:  
- Emerging Tech Provides New Affordances >     
- Creators Explore New Affordances >  
- Distributors Provide Channels For Audiences to Access New Work >  
- Audience learn grow to watch new work & Provide feedback >  

###### Adaptation of Innovation

- **Innovators** 2.5%    
- **Early Adopters** 13.5%  / People who want complete solutions  ! Crossing the Chasm
- **Early majority** 34%  
- **Late majority** 34%  
- **Laggards** 16%   

######  Gartner Hype Cycle

.... Current state of innovation.
