# Lore

The backstory created around a fictional universe should provide believable and convincing settings, which should intertwine with design and gameplay assumptions. Everything is adffectred by cuyltuiral and biological pressure, they dont exist in vacuum (feeding, reproducing).   
**Holon** represents a way to overcome the dichotomy between parts and wholes. Koestler's Holon Simultaneously Whole & Part.
- Multiple co-existing rules.
- Rules for all characters must be the same. A consistent world is a believable world.
- We are in our cultural bubble so its easy to slip of with our cultural point of view and embed them into the fictional worlds.
- Further to future more detailed designs
- Gaps in the world allow players to participate in its existence. When details are ambiguous, people will fill them in themselves, driven by curiosity. Hard vs soft World Design.
  - hard [rules consistency transparency realism ]explain everything < immerse by place in belivbeble and grounded world
  - soft [unknown flexible rules imaginative involvement]situational that are convincing independ of logic telling all liogic behind will destroy the curisoity [i.e. story from child persective should be somehow naive nad not fully logical ]

# Pace



## Pace layers
Make story on various level of magnification
Every world is holistic system At multiple scales (Consistency  Believability)

#### Peace size scale
- Human world: `Self`/`Individual (character)`, `Family (Home, environment)`, `Community`, `Others (Citizens)`, `World`, `Cosmos`  
- Human organism: `Organism` > `Organs` > `Tissues` > `Vells` > `Organelles` > `Molecules` > `Atoms`


#### Paces time scales
Pace scales by _Stuart Brand  and (architect Frank Duffy)_ - Six layers that function simultaneously at different speeds within society

|Years | Stuart Brand layer | Function | Frank Duffy | Bourdieu|
| - | - | - | - | - |
0|Fashion, Art | Innovate (New Ideas, competitive) | Stuff (Sets changes)| Events
5|Commerce | Differentiation (better ideas, unique process)| Space Plan (Furniture changes)|
15|Infrastructure | Record (slow, incremental, preservation, efficiency, common ideas) | Service (pipes and maintenance )| Economic / Society
70|Governance | | Skin, (human)|
100|Culture |  | Structure (building )|
forever | Nature |  | Site (place, )| Environment

**Economy cycle**
- 10 years - credit cycle - crisis    
- 100 years - world power cycle: reserve currencies `1450 Portugal` > `1530 Spain` > `1640 nith` > `1720 Fr` > `1815 GB` > `1944 US` > `crypto`
- 1000 years - governance of humanity cycle: `Tribes`  > `Religions` > `Kingdoms` > `Governance`

**Speed of change**

|||||
| - | - | - | - |
Fast | Discontinues | absorb shock, learn, innovation, revolution | Has all the attention
Slow| Continuous | integrate shock, constraint, consistency | Has all the power



# Structures


- **Structure** - Matter
- **Information** - Genetics
- **Energy** - Metabolism

#####  Pathetic Dot Theory
 _Lawrence Lessig_ It discusses how lives of individuals (the pathetic dots in question) are regulated by four forces:
- **Law** - threatens sanction if it is not obeyed.
- **Market** - supply and demand
- **existing conditions**- Technology,m biology, geography, technology and others constrain our actions.
- **Cultural Norms** - enforced by the community


#####  lex McDowells Mandala

- Disruption - what if   
- Context - where   
- Ecologies - social/ mental / physical urban planinag   
- Domains / sub - transtpot system / fasion / technologies    

.
- system   
- location   
- maker   
- body   
- culture   

.
- **Self** (culture, history)
- **Body** (structure terrain)  
- **Mind** (Governance > economic)
- **Fuel** (Energy> Resources)



##### G.R.A.P.E.S.
- **Geography**
- **Religion**
- **Achievements**
- **Politics**
- **Economy**
- **Social**



# Geography
Condition and adaptation to explore and source energy.
Spieces tend to get out of natural boundaries and limitations, and sometimes idiosyncrasies - past social pressures which are presently outdated.

## Ecosystems    
- plants > get energy from sun  > bugs eat plants  > lizard eat bugs.   
- find niche and adapt.  shifting landscape of available niches and adaptations that find opportunities. (evolutionary pathway)  
- simple systems have problem with less potential of emergence   
- i.e.: planet rotate slowly force to migrate society every few decades

**Climatology & Atmosphere**  
- Impacto of climate
- Impact of weather
- Impact of seasons


**Geophysical / Terrain**   
- Geomorphology
- Hydrology
- Tectonics
- Gravity


## Biosphere
- predators competiton
- strategies of survive


## Resources
- export/ import
- natural resources
- chance of survival
- food sources, water sources
