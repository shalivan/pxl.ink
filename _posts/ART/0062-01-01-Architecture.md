# Architecture

Arch as response to anchors:  needs / function / context / local constrain /  external conditions  (sun: south wall is most efficient, land features)


# Form
Point of contact between mass and space

- forms, (space, structure) , outward expression. (size scale texture ) emotions (formal language create forms)
- shapes (l- shelter and open , long sides... )

| | |
|--|--|
![](/src/arch/add.png)  | Additive | picturesque, full of movement,
![](/src/arch/sub.png)  |Subtractive   | generous, When regular form mising volume peart but retain identity




#### Imposible Figure
M.C. Escher


# Space
 Space is formed by relationship to object within. Literal space define scene by Degree of enclosure.

 |  |  |Enclosure Spaces|
 |--|--| --|
 ![](/src/arch/floor.png) | Floor | topology / architecture Man made / natural, Unmodulated / Modulated, Ground stability, Balcony
 ![](/src/arch/columns.png) |Columns | Obelisk, Column (europeans order), Pier, Pilaster. (Rhythm > directionality) (forming subspaces, fasades)
 ![](/src/arch/wall.png) |Walls |
 ![](/src/arch/door.png) |Doors | Point of acces, Treshold, Guide to movement- determin the rdirection and scheme of circulation within room
 ![](/src/arch/windows.png) |Windows | Air, Light, View, modulation of facade, as scaling element
 ![](/src/arch/stairs.png) |Staircase | As step, As seat, Physical link, Storage, Escalator Ladder Ramp Elevator Straight Spiral Staiecase.  
 ![](/src/arch/roof.png) |Roofs | Spatial Enclosure, Volume modulator. Folded, Curved, Membrane, Frame

Veranda, Terrace, Patio, Potch, Goyer, Lobby, Vestibule, Antresola, Balcony, Portico, Anteroom, Gallery


#### Implied  Space

| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/src/arch/implied2.png) |Implied|When elements or spaces are not explicit but are nonetheless apparent. Perspective in 2d is implied

- implied by shadow (shadow space )
- half-roofing
- platform Schodki (sugerowana),
- open colonnade   

#### Negative Space


| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/src/arch/court.png) |Negative | Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s)




- court
- horizon height- separation and connections



## Spatial Form

##### Organization
is both the physical and material solid-stuff of the built environment and its void-space. It is meant to capture the relationship between solid form and void-form

- **Plane Layout** - indoor, outdoor, connection
- **Pace** - change frequency over time by density over sopace (close spaceing make illusion of fast movement) Repetiton and Rythm


| | |
|--|--|
|Centralized  
|Linear |(corridor with rooms)
|Radial | Panopticon (round prison)
|Clustered | Hub
|Grid | Organization
|Asymmetry | Irregular




##### Relationship



Space-space relations

| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/src/arch/within.png) | Space within other space|
![](/src/arch/inter.png) | Interlocking  |(shared by 2 spaces)
![](/src/arch/edge.png)  |Edge / Face contact |
![](/src/arch/corridor2.png) | Links | corridors
![](/src/arch/spatial.png)  |Spatial tension|

Building - ground/horizon relation

.
##### Function

| |  |
|--|--|
|Public   |
|Private | Spatial empathy - personal space
|Circulation paths | people criculaTION
|Detail / distortions - aesthetic
