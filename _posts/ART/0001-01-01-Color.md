The property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way it reflects or emits light.


- people have Trichromatic Vision - RGB

# color harmony
- grays comunicate with each other

   - `The Opponent-Process Theory`, `Trichromatic Theory`  
   - Color temperature  vs  neutral colors (W&B and gray)   
   - Work in `HSV` to manage `Chroma` and `Valor` .   

**HSV**   
- Hue - perceived colors. dependent on its dominant wavelength and independent of intensity or lightness.
- Saturation (Chroma) - the strength or dominance of the hue.  
- Lightness (Valor) -  or darkness of the hue.

**Compose Colors**

   || |
   |-|- |
   `Monochrome` | 1 color
   `Analogous`| Similar
   `Complimentary` | Opposites
   `Split-Complementary` | (dominant & support + accent),
   `Triad`  |3 |
   `Tetradic` | 4   

complimentary color not both saturated. One should be desaturated


   - `Spectral Locus` plotting all visible colors can show how much sRGB is limited. rec2020 (much vide color space)      
   Environment make difference how we see image  (monitor calibration and viewing conditions)  

#### Contrast   
- `Value` high key painting has a `high-value` scale (light) vs `low-value` scale (dark).  
- `Hue/Saturation`  
- `Edge`  
- `Proximity`  
- `Texture` (material), `Shape`
