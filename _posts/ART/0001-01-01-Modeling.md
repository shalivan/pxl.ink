rosliny - kawałki z ktorych skladamy całosc i do tego dodajemy na całoś atrybuty  
NIE OPISANE: z lisci high skladamy zbrushowa roslinke

- **ref** and diferent sizes and shapes  (grass, plants, bush , tree)
  - siluethe
  - characteristic: leaf beand, begining, grouping (higher lkeafs more vertical change shape) gravitation
  - growth to the sun
- **model low** poly (parts)
  - parts (leafs, stamp)
  - symetry
  - direct leaf to create planes good for view
- **early uv** unvrap on low
  - 2 sided leafs for detail u can apply different textures (2 sided node) ie U can move uv have (right and left part on uv). (or have 2 geometrys)
  - test in engine with distance gradient alpha and check how big cutoff could be to get optimal visible part and leaf area
- **sculpt** think before sculpt if its what u need
  - make thickness and smooth to low poly
  - material id's for parts
  - sculpt
- **refine low** poly
  - minimize places with alfa to not have overdraw
  - traingulation sometimes neds to changed
- **bake**
  - by uv
- **compose** plants: arrange and deform  
  - use **simulation** to refine final shape
- set per object attributes
  - vertex color for movement  (main branch, leafs and thin edges ) / physical properties
  - normal. On bush:  `Custom Vertex normals` - transfer normal from vdb tree form.
- **painting**
  - spots with colo vatriations (some blured)
  - use also sharp lines
  - paint masks: sss,
  - vains and celular patterns
  - vines to subsurface mask!
- **material**
  - instances 2levels deep to global control
  - bend grass near player
- vertex anim **movement**  - wind and interaction
  - Tree bend, branches, leafs
  - wind for grass and branches pivoted   
  - wygiac przy playerze cardsy troche do kamery   
  - scale anim and size on distance to betere disapear LOD
  - scale grass down on laast lod
  - how fast move depend on sale smooth ramp =x*(in+1))/(x-in)   
- engine **optimization**
  - cluster foliage, procedural placement system
  - early z pass
