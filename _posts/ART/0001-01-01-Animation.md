GHame design driven
- level of importance
- shapes: simple but break symetries
- value ranges. Table for Brightest UI > tyhen character and fx > enviro.
- value keep in middlet to be able use dark or light contrast
- in one fx try use similar colors (chyba ze w hierarhi)
- Timing!! : criticval
  - All fx should have anticipation, main event and dissipation
  - Outro should be considered as separated fx (with lower values, saturation and opacity)
  - Fading energy can be represented by changing: value, hue , saturation, opacity, size
  - Color variation value, opacity are elements that can be altered in relation to an fx timing
  - color harmonizing
  - tempo (beats)
  - intensity over time. Misle: constant, explosion rapidly deselerating, peak, blink repeated, wave
  - acceletation
