# Elements & Principles

| | Design Elements |  | | |   
| -| - | - |- |- |
![](/src/gestalt/point.png)  |  **Point** | 1D
![](/src/gestalt/line.png)  |  **Line** | 2D | Shape dynamic, Variations, Single stroke
![](/src/gestalt/shape.png)  |  **Shape** | 2D | Geometric, Organic| Perception of shape depend on contrast
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)  |  **Form** | 3D |Circural (friendly) vs Jagged (danger)
![](/src/gestalt/space.png)  |  **Space** |  |Vertical (powerful), Horizontal (stability),  Negative
![](/src/gestalt/color.png)  |   [Color](/color/)  | Hue
![](/src/gestalt/value.png)  |  **Value** | Level of lightness | Build by adding or subtracting lightness
![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  |  **Texture** | | Properties of material.
![](/src/gestalt/a.png)   |  **Typo**  | Typography| Serif, Sans Serif, Script, Monospaced, Display

 **Principles of Design**

 | | |    | |
 | -  | - | - | - |
 |  |  **Balance** | Optical (not mathematical)  distribution of visual **Weight**, **Gravity** **Pressure**
 |  |  **Emphasis** |  Element **Dominance**. **Attention** given to some aspect of a compositon
 |  |  **Contrast** | **Juxtaposition** of elements with oposite attributes to emphasis or attract attention
 |  |  **Proportion**  | Scaling elements as they relay to each other. **Relative Size** or ammount
 |  |  **Movement** | Lines, edge, color or path that imply **Direction** (flying birds, road)
 |  |  **Repetition** | Similar elements in **Sequence**. Create **Rhythm** or **Pattern**. **Pacing**, interlock (zagniezdzanie), echos
 |  |  **Unity** | all elements together create **Harmony**
 |  |  **Variety** | hold viewer attention

# References

 Things not working from memory. Its crucial.  

 | . | |  |
 | --- | --- |--- |
 |**DNA** | `Culture` aesthetic,  History `Period` ('80), `Function` , engeneering , life expectency economic |Universal, Cultural / Animalistic, Manufactured    
 |**Material** | `Substance`, `Stiffness` | Smooth, Rough / Leather, Spandex
 |**Age**  |`Wear`, `Tear`, `Erosion`, `Dirt`,  `Scratches`  
 |**Pattern** | | Uniform, Fractal
 |**Motion**  | `Nature of motion` | Organic, Mechanic
 |other specifics...   || Minimalistic or Rich, thin, heavy, wytrzyały, zasady swaita, socio-political influences




# Conception

 Concept is communication form. Can help in further development if references are insufficient. Can be in various forms, sketch of design

 - Exploration: `variations` and `iterations` (make 3 options and hybridize  based on feedback) Options, not variations. Variations are for finished concept.
 - Concept should be usable
 - Form perspective to be able `to translate` directly to 3d
 - Draw additional `side views` and important elements.
 - Don't limit yourself. Use 3d, textures, kit bash, references, photo bash


## Scale
   - `proportions` are critical. If sth to thick > like a toy can change perception!  
   - Refer to `human scale` and show `relations` with other objects     
   - lot of fog make enviro bigger

## Silhouettes

 [Graphic Design](/graphicdesign/)

 ```
 Engeniging vs design (human centric)prototypes  
 design thinking is methodology   
 engeniers check if it work correctly  
 prototypes - ask question expose asumptions and sneek to the future
 ```

 ## Harmony vs Chaos


#  Design

The applied arts. Design is a language. Its thinking, never generic! It work as a **form in the context**.

 - **Brief** `Parti pris` – statement of design goals and constraints
 - **Analysis** – analysis of current design goals **form** and **function**  
 - Choose **key words** for representative things, to get essence.
 - **Research** – Create board. investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
 - Order ref. and **make idea clear**, choose and mark part of references you want to use to avoid ambiguity.
 - **Design**  Start on easy perspectives like side view


 recognize features ...  
 form follow function  
-  (Maked for speed? like motocycles  ) when was made '80 '90. Different character. Curved or quad, weight, level of detail
- Animalistic features. Design base on anture or manufactured items
- Harmony and dissonance

### Patterns

- general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object oriented system
- general arrangement of objects and classes
harmony

[book: Notes on the Synthesis of Form] Ryan Singer, “Designing with Forces: How to Apply Christopher Alexander in Everyday Work ”
 - explain why
 - draw line between form and context. found boundary
 - identify forces that make demands on the form (form of crownsplash show all forces that influence the splash),
 - resolve forces to diagrams, so there is no friction or conflict. (workflow, hierarhy)
 - improve existing design  Look at existing design in usefull way.

[a pattern language]


### Design from base
 u know what things are. culturally programed by life.
 Cultural norms
 grounded in cultular aseptence
 find anchor point to build designs around llike: circle
 strong visual language help identify patterns


#### Anchors
##### Design for existing settings

  if u need design something in similar style reverse engenire understand design influences  and intention. Find references they maight use


#### Visual Library
 exposed to visual library


#### Subject matter



#### Subject costs

 - Difficulty of subject matter:
 easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion
 science -fiction most difficult because u must be ahead with thought

 dirt and destroyed  - easier
 clean  

 dark - cheaper to produce  
 bright - explensive  

 existing - cheaper  
 non existing  

 past - cheap  
 future - expensive  


 - interesting siluethe - easier to draw  
 - if simple sil. harder to fill with detail (may require possing dificult forms )  


#### Detail ()
 - sprawdz jaki poziom detalu bedzie widoczny w finalnej produkcji



###  aristotle's four causes
four causes are, of course, the material, formal, final, and efficient causes.
The four causes signify ways in which a thing is indebted for its existence.

# UX/UI


- **Diegetic**  - Source of information came from the world   recounted story
- **Nondiegetic** - Source of information came from outside commentary sound / HUD (out of world)



 - Consistency / Intentionallyty
 - Ergonomy. The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
 - Visual Feedback
 - Simplicity / Cognitive Load. (The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.)

 **UI types**:
 - non-Diagetic,
 - Diagetic,
 - Spatial,
 - Meta

 **UI elements**

 Iconography - construction grid, smallest point   
 Typograpth -    


- światło, równowaga optyczna patternu
