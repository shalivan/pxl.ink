human vision is not linear
####  Human color perception
- People have Trichromatic Vision - Cone cells are sensitive in bandth in wavelength of RGB. Where G and B receptros are ovelaping more and have bigger sensitivity.
- Environment make difference how we see image  (monitor calibration and viewing conditions)  
- The property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way it reflects or emits light.
- https://youtu.be/gnUYoQ1pwes?t=1086   
- Visible range is 400–700 nanometers (nm)  blue (S repetor)  + G (M receptor) & R (L receptor)
- 19% is middle gray

#### Theories:
- **Trichromatic Theory** - 3 cone types and combination let us see spectrum. (**RGB**)
- **The Opponent-Process Theory** - Complementarty to trichromatic. working in pares and complement each other. (**RGBY**) Inability to color combine. Oposites:  
 1. Collect all 3 type of cones and represent: `Yellow` + `Blue`  
 2. Collect info from red and green cones:  `Red` + `Green`
 visible in experiment: 'Color after image'.
- human better see darker colors

#### Additive and Subtractive.
- **RYB** - `Subtractive`. Mixing get darker (ink CMYK) Primary: `Red`, `Yellow`, `Blue` sec: `Orange` (Red+Yellow), `Purple` (Red + Blue), `Green` (Yellow + Blue). for mixing pigments and light filters.
- **RGB** - `Additive`. mixing get white  (light RGB) Primary: `Red`, `Green`, `Blue`, sec: `Cyan` (blue + green), `Magenta` (red + blue), `Yellow` (Red+green)









# Digital  Representing

- **Gamut** /(of a device or process) is that portion of the color space that can be represented, or reproduced. Generally, the color gamut is ..
- **Color spaces** - In rendering colors are sometimes supersaturated. RGB cannot deal with it. Process those colors relayabley by transform fn
- **Spectral Locus** -  The curved edge of the gamut.  plotting all visible colors can show how much sRGB is limited. rec2020 (much vide color space)  



- Gamma encoding is applied to imgaes itself: sRGB. So pixel values dont represent light intensity.  
- classic workflow: ignore problem.
- linear workflow: before adjustment we are fixing data to linear.

math in sRGB is not working


- sRGB - on monitor looks like even distributinb but is not
- linear - look vanished   
- 19% of light intensity is percived by us as half . (and 50% of sRGB is 21% linear so after gamma applied is appealing and natural for eye)

#### Work with colors

for correction:
- wrong nameing: Shadows / mid / light. Never use in linear !!!!
- for sRgb: Lift - mostly in darks / Gamma - mostly in midtones / Gain - mostly in ligt
- linear space: offset / power / slope.

### RGB  

...  
...   

### HSV & HSL  
HSV blending is usually better, yes, but it has its share of problems too. not every pair of colors are neighbors
so you can end up transitioning through weird hues, also the V in HSV (or L in HSL) do not properly represent the true luminance of a color.
- They are not actually color spaces, they are ways of remapping RGB color spaces to parameters that are easier to work with.  
 - **HSV** to manage `Chroma` and `Valor` .   
   - `Hue` (0-360) - perceived colors. dependent on its dominant wavelength and independent of intensity or lightness. Hue is angle on circle on `Chromacity diagram` based on `CIR` based on `LMS` is white in middle. we calculate HSV from there.
   - `Saturation` (Chroma) (0-100) - the strength or dominance of the hue.  
   - `Value` (Valor) (0-100) -  Lightness/Luminance or darkness of the hue.
 - **HSL** to manage `Chroma` and `Lightness` .   




### Oklab
 photoshop “Perceptual”, is actually using Oklab
 Oklab space, above, is similar in that regard to HUSL - Human-friendly HSL
 but with much better methodology

## ACES
Solve:
- data sets to convert cameras from cameras.
-


## Color management
is about consistance.
- Displace how react to signal
- Software how is handle color



## Blending colors

You want to blend colors on hsv usually? And bspline not linear

# Color harmony

######  Compose Patterns
- `Relative Luminance`: depend on how much receptors reacts: `Cyan` appear most light then: `Green` > `Yellow` > `red` > `blue` appear as darkest. (blue receptor response least)
- `Gray`s communicate with each other
- Color temperature  vs  neutral colors (W&B and gray)   
- `Natural` - not over saturated monochrome like not too much excitement. tend to gentle light gray
- `Value` high key painting has a `high-value` scale (light) vs `low-value` scale (dark).

###### Compose Colors

   || |
   |-|- |
   `Monochrome` | 1 color.
   `Analogous`| Similar
   `Complimentary` | Opposites.  not both saturated. One should be desaturated
   `Split-Complementary` | (dominant & support + accent),
   `Triad`  |3 |
   `Tetradic` | 4   


######  Warm / Cold

###### Teal and orange

vector orginalCd = @Cd ;

if (@Cd.g>(@Cd.b+@Cd.r)/2*chf('tol')){

saturation:

```
@Cd = length(@Cd)+((@Cd-length(@Cd))*chf('saturation'));
```

grading tool:

```
pow( (((((x-blackpoint) / (whitepoint-blackpoint) ) * ((gain*multiply)-lift)) +lift)+offset) , (1/gamma) )
