Cone cells are sensitive in bandth in wavelength of RGB


The property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way it reflects or emits light.

- people have Trichromatic Vision - RGB

# Additive and Subtractive.
- RYB - Subtractive. Mixing get darker (ink CMYK) Primary: Red Yellow Blue sec: Orange(Red+Yellow), Purple(Red + Blue), Green(Yellow + Blue)  
- RGB - Additive. mixing get white  (light RGB) Primary: Red Green Blue, sec: Cyan(blue + green) Magenta(red + blue) Yellow(Red+green)


# color apperience brightness
cyan most light then green > yellow > red > blue

# color harmony
- grays communicate with each other

   - `The Opponent-Process Theory`, `Trichromatic Theory`  
   - Color temperature  vs  neutral colors (W&B and gray)   
   - Work in `HSV` to manage `Chroma` and `Valor` .   

**HSV**   
- Hue - perceived colors. dependent on its dominant wavelength and independent of intensity or lightness.
- Saturation (Chroma) - the strength or dominance of the hue.  
- Lightness (Valor) -  or darkness of the hue.

**Compose Colors**

   || |
   |-|- |
   `Monochrome` | 1 color.
   `Analogous`| Similar
   `Complimentary` | Opposites.  not both saturated. One should be desaturated
   `Split-Complementary` | (dominant & support + accent),
   `Triad`  |3 |
   `Tetradic` | 4   

**Warm/Cold** -  

- natural - not over saturated monochrome like not too much excitement. tend to gentle light gray



   - `Spectral Locus` plotting all visible colors can show how much sRGB is limited. rec2020 (much vide color space)      
   Environment make difference how we see image  (monitor calibration and viewing conditions)  


#### Contrast   
- `Value` high key painting has a `high-value` scale (light) vs `low-value` scale (dark).  
- `Hue/Saturation`  
- `Edge`  
- `Proximity`  
- `Texture` (material), `Shape`

# Symbolism

B&W| death evil / good pure innocent divine

Yellow  | Cheery Warm Happy
Green | Luck Growth Healing Health Nature Weath


# Color representation

Color spaces
In rendering colors are sometimes supersaturated. RGB cannot deal with it. Process those colors relayabley by transform fn
