# Elements & Principles

 **Design Elements**

| |  |  | | |   
| -| - | - |- |- |
![](/src/gestalt/point.png)  |  **Point** | 1D
![](/src/gestalt/line.png)  |  **Line** | 2D | Shape dynamic, Variations, Single stroke
![](/src/gestalt/shape.png)  |  **Shape** | 2D | Geometric, Organic| Perception of shape depend on contrast
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)  |  **Form** | 3D |Circural (friendly) vs Jagged (danger)
![](/src/gestalt/space.png)  |  **Space** |  |Vertical (powerful), Horizontal (stability),  Negative
![](/src/gestalt/color.png)  |  **Color** [Color](/color/)  | Hue
![](/src/gestalt/value.png)  |  **Value** | Level of lightness | Build by adding or subtracting lightness
![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  |  **Texture** | | Properties of material.
![](/src/gestalt/a.png)   |  **Typo**  | Typography| Serif, Sans Serif, Script, Monospaced, Display

 **Principles of Design**

 | | |    | |
 | -  | - | - | - |
 |  |  **Balance** | Optical (not mathematical)  distribution of visual **Weight**, **Gravity** **Pressure**
 |  |  **Emphasis** |  Element **Dominance**. **Attention** given to some aspect of a compositon
 |  |  **Contrast** | **Juxtaposition** of elements with oposite attributes to emphasis or attract attention
 |  |  **Proportion**  | Scaling elements as they relay to each other. **Relative Size** or ammount
 |  |  **Movement** | Lines, edge, color or path that imply **Direction** (flying birds, road)
 |  |  **Repetition** | Similar elements in **Sequence**. Create **Rhythm** or **Pattern**. **Pacing**
 |  |  **Unity** | all elements together create **Harmony**
 |  |  **Variety** | hold viewer attention



# References  & Design



 Things not working from memory. Its crucial.    
 Design thinking not generic!   
 The applied arts. Design is a language.


 - **Brief** `Parti pris` – statement of design goals and constraints
 - **Analysis** – analysis of current design goals **form** and **function**  
 - Choose **key words** for representative things, to get essence.
 - **Research** – Create board. investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
 - Order ref. and **make idea clear**, choose and mark part of references you want to use to avoid ambiguity.
 - **design**  Start on easy perspectives like side view

 |**DNA** | `Culture` aesthetic,  History `Period` ('80), `Function` , engeneering , life expectency economic |Universal, Cultural / Animalistic, Manufactured    
 |**Material** | `Substance`, `Stiffness` | Smooth, Rough / Leather, Spandex
 |**Age**  |`Wear`, `Tear`, `Erosion`, `Dirt`,  `Scratches`  
 |**Pattern** | | Uniform, Fractal
 |**Motion**  | `Nature of motion` | Organic, Mechanic
 |other specifics...   || Minimalistic or Rich, thin, heavy, wytrzyały, zasady swaita, socio-political influences



  (Maked for speed? like motocycles  ) when was made '80 '90. Different character. Curved or quad, weight, level of detail

 recognize features ...  
 form follow function  

 Animalistic features. Design base on anture or manufactured items

 - Harmony and dissonance

 ## Design for existing settings

 if u need design something in similar style reverse engenire understand design influences  and intention. Find references they maight use

 ## Design from base
 u know what things are. culturally programed by life.
 Cultural norms
 grounded in cultular aseptence
 find anchor point to build designs around llike: circle
 strong visual language help identify patterns




 #### Visual Library
 exposed to visual library


 #### Subject matter



 #### Subject costs

 - Difficulty of subject matter:
 easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion
 science -fiction most difficult because u must be ahead with thought

 dirt and destroyed  - easier
 clean  

 dark - cheaper to produce  
 bright - explensive  

 existing - cheaper  
 non existing  

 past - cheap  
 future - expensive  


 - interesting siluethe - easier to draw  
 - if simple sil. harder to fill with detail (may require possing dificult forms )  


 #### Detail ()
 - sprawdz jaki poziom detalu bedzie widoczny w finalnej produkcji

# UX/UI


- **Diegetic**  - Source of information came from the world   recounted story
- **Nondiegetic** - Source of information came from outside commentary sound / HUD (out of world)



 - Consistency / Intentionallyty
 - Ergonomy. The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
 - Visual Feedback
 - Simplicity / Cognitive Load. (The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.)

 **UI types**:
 - non-Diagetic,
 - Diagetic,
 - Spatial,
 - Meta

 **UI elements**

 Iconography - construction grid, smallest point   
 Typograpth -
