# Rest..
Metaxis - sence of inbetween 
Synthesis - transcend and include previouse modernism and postm. 

- **Structuralists** - looking at the underlining stuctures.  Words have no internal meaning, only in the relation to sth else. Meaning is something not present in text itself. Like jazz. **structuralists**: notes that u dont play. (**post structuralists**:  whitch notes you exacly did you not play, and why did you not play)
