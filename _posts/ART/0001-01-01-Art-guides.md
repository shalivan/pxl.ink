# HowTo

- Understand medium
- Don't save on hardware


# Cognition

- **Don't make excuses**.   
- **Practice**
- **Perseverance**. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- **Habits** help to free mind of thinking about basics. Rhythm have benefits
- **Control attention span**. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.

# Planning  

   - **Identify** possible `obstacles` that can interrupt and `constraints` that can slow you down.
   - Check `anchors` to work within restrictions.
   - Use **limitations as strength**
   - Work on main issues and resolve **core problems**.  
   - Break **complex problems**: into pieces
   - **Pipelines**: to make data and information flow through easy
   - Make it **simple** (simple rule > complicated behavior)
   - Have **crumple zone** to be able to reduce scope
   - planing is about **time** vs detail
   - Automation > proceduralism
   - **RnD** - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  


   Detail precision and nuance creates fidelity   
   Iterations  

- Difficulty of subject matter: easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion
- Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to

- Ground things to make it believable
