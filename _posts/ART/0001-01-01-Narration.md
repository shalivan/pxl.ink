##### Story  & Plot
>A story is a series of events recorded in their chronological order. A plot is a series of events deliberately arranged so as to reveal their dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance.

Cannot say a story without `Place`, `Time` and `Character`. Or you can :> ?

   - `Premise` -  Meaningful, obietnica, zapowiedz
   - `Causality` -  Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)
   - `Character` reveale when human characters make choices under pressuere
   -  Establish conflict, Twist
   - `Pacing`, `Build up` Stimulus delta over moments. Suprise changes moment to moment and our desire.




`Begining` - to engage  
`Peak` -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)
`End` - brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory  


plot along motivation  
novel, unique, cohesive, meaningfull  
Structure in gemes is not as important  

(theme and moral)

  ##### Monomyth:
