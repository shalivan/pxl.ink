 energy is primary, Form must follow

# Elements & Principles

| | Design Elements |  | | |   
| -| - | - |- |- |
![](/src/gestalt/point.png)  |  **Point** | 1D
![](/src/gestalt/line.png)  |  **Line** | 2D | Shape dynamic, Variations, Single stroke
![](/src/gestalt/shape.png)  |  **Shape** | 2D | Geometric, Organic| Perception of shape depend on contrast
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)  |  **Form** | 3D | Circular (friendly) vs Jagged (danger)
![](/src/gestalt/space.png)  |  **Space** |  |Vertical (powerful), Horizontal (stability),  Negative
![](/src/gestalt/color.png)  |   [Color](/color/)  | Hue
![](/src/gestalt/value.png)  |  **Value** | Level of lightness | Build by adding or subtracting lightness
![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  |  **Texture** | | Properties of material.
![](/src/gestalt/a.png)   |  **Typo**  | Typography| Serif, Sans Serif, Script, Monospaced, Display

 **Principles of Design**

 | | |    | |
 | -  | - | - | - |
 |  |  **Balance** | Optical (not mathematical)  distribution of visual **Weight**, **Gravity** **Pressure**
 |  |  **Emphasis** |  Element **Dominance**. **Attention** given to some aspect of a composition
 |  |  **Contrast** | **Juxtaposition** of elements with opposite attributes to emphasis or attract attention
 |  |  **Proportion**  | Scaling elements as they relay to each other. **Relative Size** or amount
 |  |  **Movement** | Lines, edge, color or path that imply **Direction** (flying birds, road)
 |  |  **Repetition** | Similar elements in **Sequence**. Create **Rhythm** or **Pattern**. **Pacing**, interlock (zagniezdzanie), echoes
 |  |  **Unity** | all elements together create **Harmony**
 |  |  **Variety** | hold viewer attention

# References

 Things not working from memory. Its crucial.  

 | . | |  |
 | --- | --- |--- |
 |**DNA** | `Culture` aesthetic,  History `Period` ('80), `Function` , engineering , life expectancy economic |Universal, Cultural / Animalistic, Manufactured    
 |**Material** | `Substance`, `Stiffness` | Smooth, Rough / Leather, Spandex
 |**Age**  |`Wear`, `Tear`, `Erosion`, `Dirt`,  `Scratches`  
 |**Pattern** | | Uniform, Fractal
 |**Motion**  | `Nature of motion` | Organic, Mechanic
 |other specifics...   || Minimalistic or Rich, thin, heavy, durability, socio-political influences, rules of the world




# Conception

 Concept is a form of communication . Can help in further development if references are insufficient. Can be in various forms, sketch of design

 - Exploration: `variations` and `iterations` (make 3 options and hybridize  based on feedback) Options, not variations. Variations are for finished concepts.
 - Concept should be usable
 - From perspective to be able `to translate` directly to 3d
 - Draw additional `side views` and important elements.
 - Don't limit yourself. Use 3d, textures, kit bash, references, photo bash

## Scale
   - `proportions` are critical. If sth to thick > like a toy can change perception!  
   - Refer to `human scale` and show `relations` with other objects     
   - lot of fog make enviro bigger

## Silhouettes

 [Graphic Design](/graphicdesign/)

 ```
 Engineering vs design (human centric)prototypes  
 design thinking is methodology  
 engineers check if it work correctly  
 prototypes - ask question expose assumptions and sneek to the future
 ```

 ## Harmony vs Chaos


#  Design

The applied arts. Design is a language. It's thinking, never generic! It works as a **form in the context**.

 - **Brief** `Parti pris` – statement of design goals and constraints
 - **Analysis** – analysis of current design goals **form** and **function**  
 - Choose **key words** for representative things, to get essence.
 - **Research** – Create a board. investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
 - Order ref. and **make idea clear**, choose and mark part of references you want to use to avoid ambiguity.
 - **Design**  Start on easy perspectives like side view

 recognize features ...  
 form follow function  
-  (Marked for speed? like motorcycles  ) when it was made '80 '90. Different characters. Curved or quad, weight, level of detail
- Animalistic features. Design base on nature or manufactured items
- Harmony and dissonance

## Patterns

- general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object oriented system
- general arrangement of objects and classes
harmony


 - explain why
 - draw a line between form and context. found boundary
 - identify forces that make demands on the form (form of crown splash show all forces that influence the splash),
 - resolve forces to diagrams, so there is no friction or conflict. (workflow, hierarchy)
 - improve existing design  Look at existing design in useful way.

[a pattern language]
[book: Notes on the Synthesis of Form] Ryan Singer, “Designing with Forces: How to Apply Christopher Alexander in Everyday Work ”

### Design from base
You know what things are. culturally programmed by life.
Cultural norms
grounded in cultural acceptance
find anchor point to build designs around like: circle
strong visual language help identify patterns


#### Anchors
##### Design for existing settings

If you need to design something in a similar style, reverse engineering lets you understand design influences  and intentions. Find references they might use

#### Visual Library
Exposed to visual library


#### Subject matter



#### Subject costs

- Difficulty of subject matter:
easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion
science -fiction most difficult because u must be ahead with thought

dirt and destroyed  - easier
clean  

dark - cheaper to produce  
bright - expensive  

existing - cheaper  
non existing  

past - cheap  
future - expensive  


- interesting silhouette - easier to draw  
- if simple sil. harder to fill with detail (may require posing difficult forms )  


#### Detail ()
 - sprawdź jaki poziom detalu będzie widoczny w finalnej produkcji



###  aristotle's four causes
four causes are, of course, the material, formal, final, and efficient causes.
The four causes signify ways in which a thing is indebted for its existence.

# UX/UI


- **Diegetic**  - Source of information came from the world   recounted story
- **Non-Diegetic** - Source of information came from outside commentary sound / HUD (out of world)
- Spatial
- Meta

 - Consistency / Intentionality
 - Ergonomy. The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
 - Visual Feedback
 - Simplicity / Cognitive Load. (The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.)

 **UI elements**

 Iconography - construction grid, smallest point  
 Typography -
