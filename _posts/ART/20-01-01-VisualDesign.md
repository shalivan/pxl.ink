# Visual Design 
Organize for perception
- Ambiguity evoke thinking. 
- Less detail will stimulates and engage the imagination more. Will pull you in. 

 #### Engineering vs design (human centric) prototypes  
 design thinking is methodology  -  prototypes - ask question expose assumptions and sneak to the future
 engineers check if it work correctly  

# Elements

#### Vitruvian triad
**Sustainable**, **Beneficial**, **Attractive**

#### Dieter Rams
**Innovative**, **Useful**, **Aesthetic**, makes a product **understandable**, **unobtrusive**, **honest**, **long-lasting**,** thorough down** to the last detail, environmentally-friendly, **little design as possible**.
- **Simplicity** - to quick communicate and protecting from complexity.
design great to communicate idea quickly
- **Energy is primary** - Form must follow.
- **Harmony vs Chaos**


#### Aristotle's four causes
Four causes are, of course, the **material**, **formal**, **final**, and **efficient** causes.
The four causes signify ways in which a thing is indebted for its existence.

#  Design Methodology

The applied arts. Design is a language. It's thinking, never generic! It works as a **form in the context**.
 - **Brief** `Parti pris` – statement of design goals and constraints
 - **Analysis** – analysis of current design goals **form** and **function**  
 - Choose **key words** for representative things, to get essence.
 - **Research** – Create a board. investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
 - Order ref. and **make idea clear**, choose and mark part of references you want to use to avoid ambiguity.
 - **Design**  Start on easy perspectives like side view

 recognize features ...  









 form follow function  
-  (Marked for speed? like motorcycles  ) when it was made '80 '90. Different characters. Curved or quad, weight, level of detail
- Animalistic features. Design base on nature or manufactured items
- Harmony and dissonance



#### Subject costs

- Difficulty of subject matter:
easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion
science -fiction most difficult because u must be ahead with thought

### Subject matter

### Design from base
You know what things are. culturally programmed by life.   
Cultural norms    
grounded in cultural acceptance   
find anchor point to build designs around like: circle   
strong visual language help identify patterns    
Use !! **Anchors** as advantages  

### Design for existing settings

If you need to design something in a similar style, reverse engineering lets you understand design influences  and intentions. Find references they might use






# References

elevated fantasy - contradiction. Fantasy or contemporary. 


 Things not working from memory. Its crucial therefore we need references.

 | . | |  |
 | --- | --- |--- |
 |**DNA** | `Culture` aesthetic,  History `Period` ('80), `Function` , engineering , life expectancy economic |Universal, Cultural / Animalistic, Manufactured    
 |**Material** | `Substance`, `Stiffness` | Smooth, Rough / Leather, Spandex
 |**Age**  |`Wear`, `Tear`, `Erosion`, `Dirt`,  `Scratches`  
 |**Pattern** | | Uniform, Fractal
 |**Motion**  | `Nature of motion` | Organic, Mechanic
 |other specifics...   || Minimalistic or Rich, thin, heavy, durability, socio-political influences, rules of the world




- WHAT - Fundamentald & Technical skills 
- WHERE - Exteriors, interiors, scale 
- WHEN - Period appropriate details 
- WHO - Human Experiences & Interactive designs 
- WHY - Entertainment value & story elements 



# Conception

 Concept is a form of communication . Can help in further development if references are insufficient. Can be in various forms, sketch of design

 - Exploration: `variations` and `iterations` (make 3 options and hybridize  based on feedback) Options, not variations. Variations are for finished concepts.
 - Concept should be usable
 - From perspective to be able `to translate` directly to 3d
 - Draw additional `side views` and important elements.
 - Don't limit yourself. Use 3d, textures, kit bash, references, photo bash


## Scale
   - `proportions` are critical. If sth to thick > like a toy can change perception!  
   - Refer to `human scale` and show `relations` with other objects     
   - lot of fog make enviro bigger

### compression and expansion
how to use space
- hallway is directional / hall is open
- shifts are important and build pasing

## Silhouettes

#### Detail ()

Less detail will stimulates and engaage the imagination more. Will pull you in. 
Ambiguilty evoke thinking. 
  - sprawdź jaki poziom detalu będzie widoczny w finalnej produkcji


#### organisation of local values
graphic quality 
- read extreamly way on shape level 
- clear organisation of local values 


```
## Patterns

- general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object oriented system
- general arrangement of objects and classes
harmony


 - explain why
 - draw a line between form and context. found boundary
 - identify forces that make demands on the form (form of crown splash show all forces that influence the splash),
 - resolve forces to diagrams, so there is no friction or conflict. (workflow, hierarchy)
 - improve existing design  Look at existing design in useful way.

####  Human centric design

#### Evolutionary Design / Biomimicry

evolutionary and biological mechanisms
Way we percive design is  influenced by leftover survival mechanisms/ primorial instincts.

Non werbal comunication important

#### Organic design

###### Antropomorpism
We tend to antr...
human like qualities to inanimate object.
Attah human quilities to objects
build relationships and name object that dont ave thoughts and feelings
can be used to manipulate in future.
**Paradolia** - seeing faces


#### Culture and symbolism
Culture and symbolism  vs. universal trueths

Kiki Buba effect.
people paried kiki to sharp and nice B sound of buba to smooth.

- **Diegetic**  - Source of information came from the world   recounted story
- **Non-Diegetic** - Source of information came from outside commentary sound / HUD (out of world)
- Spatial
- Meta

 - Consistency / Intentionality
 - Ergonomy. The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
 - Visual Feedback
 - Simplicity / Cognitive Load. (The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.)

you can design things to be boring or look cheap at purpose

principle of least resistance - The path of least resistance is the physical or metaphorical pathway that provides the least resistance to forward motion by a given object or entity

# Product design
- start designning with parts and metodes you are familiar with. with egsiting tools
- try to imagine platonic ideal of perfect product and, reverse engeniring simplifying


visual language is important - visual is important to let humans make snap decisions about
