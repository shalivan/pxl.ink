# Attitude

## Approach

- Don't save on means. Hardware and tools defining your way.   
- Difficulty of subject matter: easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion

## Mindset

- **Don't make excuses**.   
- **Practice**
- **Understanding** Understand medium
- **Perseverance**. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- **Habits** help to free mind of thinking about basics. Rhythm have benefits
- **Control attention span**. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.



## Planning  

   - Check **anchors**  and **constraints** to work within restrictions.   
   - Identify possible **obstacles** that can interrupt or slow you down.
   - Use **limitations as strengths**.
    - Make it **simple**, optimize.(simple rule > complicated behavior).  
   - Work on main issues and resolve **core problems**.  
   - Break **complex problems** into pieces.
   - **Pipelines** - to make data and information flow through easy and prevent bottlenecks.
   - **Automate** processes. Keep things **procedural** as long you can for quick fixes.
   - Have **crumple zone** to be able to reduce scope.
   - **R'n'D** - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  
   - Quid pro quo **time vs detail** precision and nuance creates fidelity
   - Development means **Iterations**
   - Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to

# Conception

# References  & Design

Things not working from memory. Its crucial.    
Design thinking not generic!   


- **Brief** `Parti pris` – statement of design goals and constraints
- **Analysis** – analysis of current design goals **form** and **function**  
- Choose **key words** for representative things, to get essence.
- **Research** – Create board. investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
- Order ref. and **make idea clear**, choose and mark part of references you want to use to avoid ambiguity.
- **design**  

| . | |  |
| - | - |- |
|**DNA** | `Culture` aesthetic, `Time`, `Period` ('80), `Function` economic |Universal, Cultural / Animalistic, Manufactured    
|**Material** | `Substance`, `Stiffness` | Smooth, Rough / Leather, Spandex

 (Maked for speed? like motocycles  ) when was made '80 '90. Different character. Curved or quad, weight, level of detail



The applied arts. Design is a language.

## Design for existing settings

if u need design something in similar style reverse engenire understand design influences  and intention. Find references they maight use



## Concept Art
Sketch of design  
  Concept is communication form. Can help in further development if references are insufficient.

- Exploration: **variations** and **iterations** (make 3 options and hybridize  based on feedback) Options, not variations. Variations are for finished concept.
- Concept should be usable
- Form perspective to be **able to translate** directly to 3d
- Draw additional **site views** and important elements.
- Don't limit yourself. Use 3d, textures, kit bash, references, photo bash

# Composition
- have a subject matter
- **Focal point**, composition lines (but its not true that they lead eye (physically) its not literally its only specializing abstract concept ). If character in scene, focal point is where is head or where he look.
- **Rule of 3rd**  
- **Golden ratio** `sectio aurea` a+b/a = 1.618 φ  - golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ  

- **Depth**
- **Edges**
   - Occur in: `Object`, `Plane` or `Color`  
   - Types:  `Hard`, `Soft`, `Lost`
   - Avoid: (tangents) `Hidden`, `Skimmed`, `Fused`, `Stolen`
- **Crop**
   - can be indicated by shadow,
   - character can bye cropped by item
   - by edge of canvas


**Dynamic vs static**  
- dynamism: moment just `before action`, `during`, `after`
- Visual flow `Lateral Updraft`, `Bouncing`, `Stuck in vortex`, `Swipe and repeat`, `Chutes n ladders`, `Splitting atom`   
youtu.be/wBA_qGRqd20?t=267



### Perspective
lens  
camera position.
 - human camera. Eye level, or below.
 - horizon oin the shot
- fov games 60 , concept art design 90-120 (to show more even in small spaces )
---

### Scale
  - `proportion` crucial. If sth to thick > like a toy can change perception!  
  - Refer to `human scale` and show `relations` with other objects     
  - lot of fog make enviro bigger

# Draw
- Practice one line not multiple in same place
- relax arm, let lines flow  
- Flip  for perspective correction   
- Thumbnails for detail correction   
- B&W for valor correction  

##  Line drawing

**Line weight** (thickness):
- areas of shadow
- areas of form overlap
- corners creases like ao
- area with weight  (usually bottom)
- On focal point (where u should look)
- Detail Control: Most details on: Focal point / silhouettes

**Contour lines** indicate forms. (across form) give dimension. Like a directional texture on object  
**Fill** with light gray marker Build slowly  
**Highlights** - Paper not always white 100% so you can add little bit of   with white paint.

# Paint


- start with big forms then refine
- basics: dark mid light/ fore mid back-ground   





## Value
color change in light conditions.  (Green is in middle so it can change even more) so take care about value first.

- **Light values** - more light > more contrast > brain faster recognize in perfect conditions we have balance because of eye adaptation.
- **Atmosphere changed value** and add depth  (far less contrast and lighten , near local value and darker)
- **Local values** - Different materials have local values  cause of color.
but you need to have harmony in values to  communicate forms. if good and clear local values  you can read nicely even in flat lighting

**shape recognition** - shiluete  
For characters in fog you should add value to character or highlight behind (to show shiluete (its cheaper to do than expose whole character ))- common technique



## Paint Skin
   - `sun damage`, `blue veins face / forehead`, `petechiae / freckles`, `wrinkles / ance`  



# Sculpt
Sculpting is about volume, form and silhouette.  

   - `silhouettes` > `Medium Frequencies` > `Detail`      
   - Varies details placement.     
   - Sculpt across the form (not with the flow).    
   - Don't use smooth.       
   - Directionality  
   - Maintain Volume



# Character
      - layers: `skeletal`, `muscle`, `fat`, `skin`  
      - proportions  
      - character  

   face, eyes, hads,
