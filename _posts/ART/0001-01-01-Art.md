# Attitude

## Approach

- Don't save on means. Hardware and tools defining your way.   
- Difficulty of subject matter: easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion

## Mindset

- **Don't make excuses**.   
- **Practice**
- **Understanding** Understand medium
- **Perseverance**. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- **Habits** help to free mind of thinking about basics. Rhythm have benefits
- **Control attention span**. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.



## Planning  

   - Check **anchors**  and **constraints** to work within restrictions.   
   - Identify possible **obstacles** that can interrupt or slow you down.
   - Use **limitations as strengths**.
    - Make it **simple**, optimize.(simple rule > complicated behavior).  
   - Work on main issues and resolve **core problems**.  
   - Break **complex problems** into pieces.
   - **Pipelines** - to make data and information flow through easy and prevent bottlenecks.
   - **Automate** processes. Keep things **procedural** as long you can for quick fixes.
   - Have **crumple zone** to be able to reduce scope.
   - **R'n'D** - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  
   - Quid pro quo **time vs detail** precision and nuance creates fidelity
   - Development means **Iterations**
   - Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to

# Conception

## References   

Things not working from memory. Its crucial.

- **Brief** `Parti pris` – statement of design goals
- **Analysis** – analysis of current design goals
- **Research** – investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics
- Order ref. and make idea clear, choose and mark part of references you want to use to avoid ambiguity.

| . | |  |
| - | - |- |
|**DNA** | `Culture`, `Time`, `Period`, `Function` |Universal, Cultural   
|**Material** | `Substance`, `Stiffness` | Smooth, Rough / Leather, Spandex
|**Age**  |`Wear`, `Tear`, `Erosion`, `Dirt`     
|**Pattern** | | Uniform, Fractal
|**Motion**  | `Nature of motion` | Organic, Mechanic
|other specifics...   || More or Less




## Concept
  Concept is communication form. Can help in further development if references are insufficient.

- Exploration: **variations** and **iterations** (make 3 options and hybridize  based on feedback)
- Concept should be usable
- Form perspective to be **able to translate** directly to 3d
- Draw additional **site views** and important elements.
- Don't limit yourself. Use 3d, textures, kit bash, references, photo bash

duality
- **form** and **function**
- Harmony and disonance

# Composition

- Rule of 3rd  
- `sectio aurea` a+b/a = 1.618 φ  - golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ  
- Edges Can be  `Hard`, `Soft`, `Lost`
- Edge Avoid:   (tangents) `Hidden`, `Skimmed`, `Fused`, `Stolen`
- `Edges` change in `Object`, `Plane` or `Color`  
- Depth
- Focal point, composition lines (but its not true that they lead eye (physically) its not literally its only specializing abstract concept )
- Cropped things: can be indicated by shadow, character can bye cropped by item
- Dybamic vs static
- Visual flow `Lateral Updraft`, `Bouncing`, `Stuck in vortex`, `Swipe and repeat`, `Chutes n ladders`, `Splitting atom` youtu.be/wBA_qGRqd20?t=267
