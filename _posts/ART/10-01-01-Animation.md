# Animation types

- by expression or keys
- physic  simulations
- chop
`Keyframe`   
`reactive`  
`dynamic`  
`mocap data`  



## Animation

   - Timing FPS
   - Easing curves  
   - Reaction time 0.2 for see 0.1 for hear and less for touch (go / no go time decision)



# Principles of animation

| Name | | Less| More|
| --- | --- |--- | ----|
Squash & Stretch | (for VFX), emphasize speed, momentum, weight  and mass | solid stiff | soft, characters, face | try to preserve volume
Anticipation |  (for VFX) prepare for action clue what hapen next and focus action. can be multiple layers ||face |if you have time for build up do it
Staging |make idea clear: wher to look what i happenieng |
Strait Ahead vs. pose to pose |character pose to pose but hairs frame to fram  |frame by frame for unpredictable like simulations | better in most actions
Follow through, overlaping action, drag| continoue after main body stop, ofset created by drag, drag=delay main body and tips and end wchch must follow > forearm drag elbow > drag hand | TV antena | feather  
Easing |  Slow In & Out (for VFX) ! Most efect have slow in and out | robots | all rest
Arcs | living reatures move with arcs |
Secondary Actions |  (for VFX) Add more dimention lik other hand (not in focus but iomportant ) additional things that Exaturate primal effect
Timing |sometime draw on 2 afarmes (less gitter slower action) |hit| look around  
Exaturation | ||more power
Solid drawing | volume weight drawing on solid spheres. Avoid twinning (mirror)
Appeal | chrismatic aspects > dynamic design. (varietyu of shapes on dif characters), play with proportions.


## Simulation & procedural   
   - Normalize - Fit parameters to 0-1

**Game design driven**  
- shape & arena of effect. How far

**Visual**    
- level of importance
- shapes: simple but break symetries
- value ranges. Table for Brightest UI > tyhen character and fx > enviro.
- value keep in middlet to be able use dark or light contrast
- in one fx try use similar colors (chyba ze w hierarhi)

**Timing**  
  - All fx should have anticipation, main event and dissipation
  - Outro should be considered as separated fx (with lower values, saturation and opacity)
  - Fading energy can be represented by changing: value, hue , saturation, opacity, size
  - Color variation value, opacity are elements that can be altered in relation to an fx timing
  - color harmonizing
  - tempo (beats)
  - intensity over time.


| intensity over time | |||
| --- | --- |--- | ----|
|constant | missile
|acceleration
|rapidly decelerating | explosion
|peak |
|repeated | light blink
|wave |
