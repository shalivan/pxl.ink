# Architecture

Architecture
- As response to anchors:  Needs, Function, Context, Local constrain, External conditions  (sun: south wall is most efficient, land features)
- Create meaning through atmosphere rather symbolism

#### Vitruvian triangle
- **Venustas** (delight) - Aesthetic, beauty, experiential enjoyment artistry
- **Firmitas** (firmness) - Structural integrity, durability, construction quality
- **Utilitas** (commodity) - Functional adequacy, usefulness, satisfies programmatic requirements

# Form
Point of contact between mass and space. (formal language create forms)
- **Forms** -  (space, structure), **Objects** with attributes:
  - shape
  - size
  - scale
  - texture
  - location = position + orientation

| ![ \| 200](/src/arch/arch_v1.0011.png ) | Subtractive | generous, When regular form missing volume peart but retain identity |


- Form in architecture is consumed from related perspective.   
- Articulation = how elements relate (corners)  
- **Impossible Figure** - M.C. Escher - bending space  in 2d

# Space
 Space is formed by relationship to object within. Literal space defines the scene by Degree of enclosure.

## Enclosure

##### Horizon Height
Working as separation and connections


# Spatial Form

##### Organization
is both the physical and material solid-stuff of the built environment and its void-space. It is meant to capture the relationship between solid form and void-form

- **Plane Layout** - indoor, outdoor, connection
- **Pace** - change frequency over time by density over space (close spacing make illusion of fast movement) Repetition and Rhythm


##### Relationship


Space-space relations

Building - ground/horizon relation

Arrivals -  experience of reaching an important gameplay space


- Served Space - Hierarchically important space  
- Service spaces - guide players to ro somehow otherwise support the main spaces
(by Luicon)

##### Function

| |  |
|--|--|
|Public   |
|Private | Spatial empathy - personal space
|Circulation | paths, junctions, squares - people circulation
|Distortions | aesthetic detail



#### Prospect & Refuge
- rewwarding vista (moment to pause)  
- people want comfortable, seak simultaniousley p & r see predatoras but with flaks are covered :
   - so supply edges its crutial

#### Proportions

|                                        |     |                                                                                                                            |

#### UkÅ‚ady

cultural shift:
- public space on entrance + corridor tht wille take you to private dead end space. (private )
- earlier we had rooms connected to eachother - allow to spontanious interactions

off for exterior for defense and open inside

# Light
Windows vs directions    
sagrada


# Visual communication

shapes - forces drive your eyes
- narrow to wide   
- dark to light    affride  light to dark   /  ok dark to light
- high to low  

Shapep theory
- Kiki - bouba
 - circke: safe, cuddly, threatening (mickie mouse)
 - triangle: pointy (evil)
 - squrae: stable, neural, useful (old guy from up!)
can use in shape of gates.
- rect doors - stable stronghold, equal range of wive  (same chances while shooting)
- round can open for better shooting from inside out
- triangular top, can narrow view

# Urbanism

**PEDNL**
Path - communication    
Edges - between types of arch    
Nodes - comunication   
Districts -   
Landmark - view

cities
- traditional neibgourhoud is better than suburbs
- experiment with big working halls. its not most optimal
how people are not thinking and making us suburbs

- office
- retails
- dining
- entertainment
- housing
- schools
- recreation
- worship
- parking - land juice, cheap parking make more people to park + destroy downtown. consolidated - not in street sites.  

gym and restaurants need night ad day light customers


#### Architecture in layers
Set of layers operating at different timescales

Shell > Service > Scenery
[Narration](/narration/)  


## Othe spaces
- `Maze` (decive, mislead, uncertain, confusion) /
- `Labyrinth` - (non linear ineficient without possibilites of false options / way out from chaos. [.](https://www.carolshieldslabyrinth.ca/#:~:text=%22A%20labyrinth%20is%20a%20complex,as%20you%20might%20think.%20.%20.)
- `Garden` / `Theme park`

# Context
**Vernacular architecture**


# Architecture in games and  neo impressionism

```!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
in `stelth` u in disadvantage (everyth testuing u)
in arkham everything is for you  - `predator gameplay` - intimate spaces, based on batman movement metrics - u in driver seat

The design rules and solutions are largely unwritten, and are learnt informally. The same form is made over and over again with no need to question why; designers need only learn the patterns.
