# Architecture

Arch as response to anchors:  needs / function / context / local constrain /  external conditions  (sun: south wall is most efficient, land features)


#### Vitruvian triangle I b.c.
- Venustas (delight) - aesthetic, beauty, experiential enjoyment artistry
- Firmitas (firmness) - structural integrity, durability, construction quality
- Utilitas (commodity) - functional adequacy, usefulness, satisfies programmatic requirements


# Form
Point of contact between mass and space

- forms, (space, structure) , outward expression. (size scale texture ) emotions (formal language create forms)
- shapes (l- shelter and open , long sides... )

| | |
|--|--|
![](/src/arch/add.png)  | Additive | picturesque, full of movement,
![](/src/arch/sub.png)  |Subtractive   | generous, When regular form missing volume peart but retain identity




#### Impossible Figure
M.C. Escher


# Space
 Space is formed by relationship to object within. Literal space defines the scene by Degree of enclosure.

## Standard Types

 |  |  |Enclosure Spaces|
 |--|--| --|
 ![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0001.png) | Floor | topology / architecture Man made / natural, Unmodulated / Modulated, Ground stability, Balcony
 ![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0002.png) |Columns | Obelisk, Column (europeans order), Pier, Pilaster. (Rhythm > directionality) (forming subspaces, fasades)
 ![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0003.png) |Walls |
 ![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0004.png) |Doors | Point of access, Threshold, Guide to movement- determine the direction and scheme of circulation within room
 ![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0005.png) |Windows | Air, Light, View, modulation of facade, as scaling element
 ![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0007.png) |Staircase | As step, As seat, Physical link, Storage, Escalator Ladder Ramp Elevator Straight Spiral Staircase.  
 ![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0006.png) |Roofs | Spatial Enclosure, Volume modulator. Folded, Curved, Membrane, Frame

Veranda, Terrace, Patio, Potch, Goyer, Lobby, Vestibule, Antresola, Balcony, Portico, Anteroom, Gallery


## Implied  Space

| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0008.png) |Implied|When elements or spaces are not explicit but are nonetheless apparent. Perspective in 2d is implied

- implied by shadow (shadow space )
- half-roofing
- platform Schodki (sugerowana),
- open colonnade  

## Negative Space


| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/src/arch/arch_v1.0009.png) |Negative | Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s)


- court
- horizon height- separation and connections



# Spatial Form

##### Organization
is both the physical and material solid-stuff of the built environment and its void-space. It is meant to capture the relationship between solid form and void-form

- **Plane Layout** - indoor, outdoor, connection
- **Pace** - change frequency over time by density over space (close spacing make illusion of fast movement) Repetition and Rhythm


| | |
|--|--|
|Centralized  
|Linear |(corridor with rooms)
|Radial | Panopticon (round prison)
|Clustered | Hub
|Grid | Organization
|Asymmetry | Irregular




##### Relationship



Space-space relations

| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/src/arch/within.png) | Space within other space|
![](/src/arch/inter.png) | Interlocking  |(shared by 2 spaces)
![](/src/arch/edge.png)  |Edge / Face contact |
![](/src/arch/corridor2.png) | Links | corridors
![](/src/arch/spatial.png)  |Spatial tension|

Building - ground/horizon relation

Arrivals -  experience of reaching an important gameplay space


- Served Space - Hierarchically important space  
- Service spaces - guide players to ro somehow otherwise support the main spaces
(by Luicon)

##### Function

| |  |
|--|--|
|Public   |
|Private | Spatial empathy - personal space
|Circulation paths | people circulation
|Detail / distortions - aesthetic



prospect & Refuge / rewwarding vista (moment to pause)   
narrow to wide   
dark to light    affride  light to dark   /  ok dark to light
high to low  

## Architecture in layers
set of layers operating at different timescales

Shell > Service > Scenery
[Narration](/narration/)  

## Othe spaces
- Maze & Labyrinths
- Gardens

# Light
- Windows vs directions
sagrada

# Visual communication

shapes - forces drive your eyes

# Architecture in games and  neo impressionism

```!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
in `stelth` u in disadvantage (everyth testuing u)
in arkham everything is for you  - `predator gameplay` - intimate spaces, based on batman movement metrics - u in driver seat
```
