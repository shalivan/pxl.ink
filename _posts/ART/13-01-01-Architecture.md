# Architecture

Architecture
- As response to anchors:  Needs, Function, Context, Local constrain, External conditions  (sun: south wall is most efficient, land features)
- Create meaning through atmosphere rather symbolism

#### Vitruvian triangle
- **Venustas** (delight) - Aesthetic, beauty, experiential enjoyment artistry
- **Firmitas** (firmness) - Structural integrity, durability, construction quality
- **Utilitas** (commodity) - Functional adequacy, usefulness, satisfies programmatic requirements


# Form
Point of contact between mass and space. (formal language create forms)
- **Forms** -  (space, structure), **Objects** with attributes:
  - shape
  - size
  - scale
  - texture
  - location = position + oreintation

<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0010.png" width="100">  | Additive | picturesque, full of movement,
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0011.png" width="100">  |Subtractive   | generous, When regular form missing volume peart but retain identity



- Form in architecture is consumed from related perspective.   
- Articulation = how elements relate (corners)  
- **Impossible Figure** - M.C. Escher - bending space  in 2d



# Space
 Space is formed by relationship to object within. Literal space defines the scene by Degree of enclosure.

## Enclosure

 |  |  |Enclosure Spaces|
 |--|--| --|
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0001.png" width="100"> | `Floor` | Topology / Architecture,  Man made / Natural, Unmodulated / Modulated, Ground stability
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0002.png" width="100">  |`Columns` | `Obelisk`, `Column` (Europeans order), `Pier`, `Pilaster`. (Rhythm > directionality) (forming subspaces, fasades)
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0003.png" width="100"> |`Walls` |
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0004.png" width="100">  |`Doors` | `Portal`, `Gates`, `Jamb` (framuga - transfer load, somt statues) Point of access, Threshold, Guide to movement - determine the direction and scheme of circulation within room
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0005.png" width="100">  |`Windows` | `Roseta`, Air, Light, View, modulation of facade, as scaling element
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0007.png" width="100">  |`Staircase` | As step, As seat, Physical link, Storage, `Escalator` `Ladder` `Ramp` `Elevator` Straight, Spiral
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0006.png" width="100">  |`Roofs` | Spatial Enclosure, Volume modulator. Folded, Curved, Membrane, Frame

`Veranda`, `Terrace`, `Patio`, `Potch`, `Goyer`, `Lobby`, `Vestibule`, `Antresola`, `Balcony`, `Portico`, `Anteroom`, `Gallery`



## Negative Space

- Positive/ Negative - well defined, organized focal point, comfortable / leftover, uncomfortable  ???? check it

| | ||
|--|--|--|
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0009.png" width="100"> |Negative | Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s)

`Court`


## Implied  Space

| | ||
|--|--|--|
 <img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0008.png" width="100">  |Implied|When elements or spaces are not explicit but are nonetheless apparent. Perspective in 2d is implied

Implied by: Shadow (shadow space), Half-Roofing, Platform, Stairs, Open colonnade  

##### Horizon Height
Working as separation and connections


# Spatial Form

##### Organization
is both the physical and material solid-stuff of the built environment and its void-space. It is meant to capture the relationship between solid form and void-form

- **Plane Layout** - indoor, outdoor, connection
- **Pace** - change frequency over time by density over space (close spacing make illusion of fast movement) Repetition and Rhythm


| | |
|--|--|
|Centralized  
|Linear |(corridor with rooms)
|Radial | Panopticon (round prison)
|Clustered | Hub
|Grid | Organization
|Asymmetry | Irregular




##### Relationship



Space-space relations

| | ||
|--|--|--|
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0015.png" width="100">  | Links | corridors
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0012.png" width="100">  | Space within other space|
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0013.png" width="100"> | Interlocking  |(shared by 2 spaces)
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0014.png" width="100">  |Edge / Face contact |
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0016.png" width="100">   |Spatial tension|



Building - ground/horizon relation

Arrivals -  experience of reaching an important gameplay space


- Served Space - Hierarchically important space  
- Service spaces - guide players to ro somehow otherwise support the main spaces
(by Luicon)

##### Function

| |  |
|--|--|
|Public   |
|Private | Spatial empathy - personal space
|Circulation | paths, junctions, squares - people circulation
|Distortions | aesthetic detail



#### Prospect & Refuge
- rewwarding vista (moment to pause)  
- people want comfortable, seak simultaniousley p & r see predatoras but with flaks are covered :
   - so supply edges its crutial

#### Proportions

| . | | |
|--|--|--|
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0016B.png" width="100">  | 1:6 | (more is not comfortable) perceivable maximum spatial enclosure by recess line on right side (larger dist is not a refuge)
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0017.png" width="100">  | 1:3 | best for squares
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0018.png" width="100"> | 1:2  | spatial enclousuure by building height
<img src="/src/arch/arch_v1.0019.png" width="100">  | 1:1  |  best for thoroughfares


#### Układy

cultural shift:
- public space on entrance + corridor tht wille take you to private dead end space. (private )
- earlier we had rooms connected to eachother - allow to spontanious interactions

off for exterior for defense and open inside

# Light
Windows vs directions    
sagrada


# Visual communication

shapes - forces drive your eyes
- narrow to wide   
- dark to light    affride  light to dark   /  ok dark to light
- high to low  

Shapep theory
- Kiki - bouba
 - circke: safe, cuddly, threatening (mickie mouse)
 - triangle: pointy (evil)
 - squrae: stable, neural, useful (old guy from up!)
can use in shape of gates.
- rect doors - stable stronghold, equal range of wive  (same chances while shooting)
- round can open for better shooting from inside out
- triangular top, can narrow view

# Urbanism

**PEDNL**
Path - communication    
Edges - between types of arch    
Nodes - comunication   
Districts -   
Landmark - view

cities
- traditional neibgourhoud is better than suburbs
- experiment with big working halls. its not most optimal
how people are not thinking and making us suburbs

- office
- retails
- dining
- entertainment
- housing
- schools
- recreation
- worship
- parking - land juice, cheap parking make more people to park + destroy downtown. consolidated - not in street sites.  

gym and restaurants need night ad day light customers


#### Architecture in layers
Set of layers operating at different timescales

Shell > Service > Scenery
[Narration](/narration/)  


## Othe spaces
- `Maze` (decive, mislead, uncertain, confusion) /
- `Labyrinth` - (non linear ineficient without possibilites of false options / way out from chaos. [.](https://www.carolshieldslabyrinth.ca/#:~:text=%22A%20labyrinth%20is%20a%20complex,as%20you%20might%20think.%20.%20.)
- `Garden` / `Theme park`



# Architecture in games and  neo impressionism

```!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
in `stelth` u in disadvantage (everyth testuing u)
in arkham everything is for you  - `predator gameplay` - intimate spaces, based on batman movement metrics - u in driver seat
```

## Architects
**Étienne-Louis Boullée**   
**Adolphe Appia**  1862 – 29 February 1928      
**Peter Zumthor** The Therme Vals - mood&tone     
gaudi - (sagrada familia) simulating shapes    
frei oto - (olipmiapark, tent like structures)  minimal surface
**Christopher Alexander** - Computaion, Math, Architect -  aktualnie postrzegana jako błędna but: ‘Unselfconscious design’ (or ‘craft-based’ design) concerns the use of traditional building methods, in which the designer works directly on the form (so, if you were a wheelwright, the wheel) unselfconsciously, through a complex two-directional interaction between the context and the form, in the world itself. The design rules and solutions are largely unwritten, and are learnt informally. The same form is made over and over again with no need to question why; designers need only learn the patterns.
