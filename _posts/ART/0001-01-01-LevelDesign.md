Control environment instead of camera like in movies. Contain: aesthetic + functionality
LD driven by mechanics. Books imagine, movie see, games act.


# Concept

- Restrictions, goals, context.   
- Scale, mertics and proportions .  
- Blockout, and props  
- form follow function   
- backdrop (non-playable area  
- Giving the player depth cues by  reference   
- obj with fixed size = car, without = tree    
- Readability  
- Signposting  

- **Critical path** = The quickest and most direct route to beating the level.
- **Golden path** = The designers ‘preferred’ route. It’s the one you expect most players to take and the one which will offer the optimal experience.


- minimize cognitive load. to avoid struggle with processing information's . to much details sensory overload


##### Intentionality
Afford present player options and goals > formulate plan > act with intentionality
Linearity feels bad could be caused by week intentionality
what to do but not how to do it

# Navigation


1. observe
2. Plan
3. Act
4. React

## Guidance
- ui
- in game visuals
- narrative (AI)


## Saliency
**Where to look** -  Attention garbing - control where player and cam look

  - **Bottom up Saliency**- Contrast, movement  (Stronger in cinema cause we are chilling)
  - **Top-Down Saliency**- Humans (meaning), NowSilent (We care now) (Stronger in goal/task orient mode) Human faces, people, things associated with our current task/goal (attentional goals).  

**attentional goals**  help players notice and pay attention to things  - (which can mean you become more ‘blind’ to other things). a locked gate they might assume the goal forward is to open the gate (even though the solution is to climb out a window).It’s also worth noting that if players are already focused on something  else


## Affordances
**Where to go**  Window affordance looking through.  Door afford enter ...  You can design way player will know how to use things. Show clear way a possibility    



- **Positive** affordance: affords to be used   
- **Negative** affordance: doesn’t afford to be used and can’t be  / Nope zone
- **False** affordance: ! looks like it affords to be used but can’t

**Types**


- Affordable **Objects** - Machines, doors...
- Affordable **Surface**  - floor. we walk to affordance surface to walk. along longest sight lights. (or somewhere else if there could be price)



**Prospect & Refuge**


- **Prospect** -  View
- **Refuge**  - Safety places. This kept our ancestors safe from enemies/predators and the elements, meet basic human psychological needs.  (evolutionary heritage). provide people with the capacity to observe (prospect)


- **Primary**  - you have now both
- **Secondary** - we have only one and see second far away is only promise)

**Encourage**


- **Mystery** - If there is information to learn
- **Teasing** - Show what you can get


high level long term goals. not pull a leaver.



## Secrets

- **Breadcrumbing** -  sending brief and sporadic messages. Trail of something (usually pickups or information) that leads the player in the right direction or towards  
- **Hints** - Slight or indirect indication or suggestion. (notes on paper, maps, signs)

# Space



### Orientation

**where I am**  In games Perceptual pattern to create Orientation  
- Signposting (oznaczenia charakterystyczne dla areny)
- Divide to district / zroznicuj areny (to distinc in map and mind )


Way finding elements:
dont lead player where to go but how move through space

- `Landmarks` - individual object - `Wniees` - mystery element + landmark
- `District` - with unique fulvous
- `Linear elements` - Path, rivers.
- `Edges` - Walls, rivers (temporary / depended)  
- `Nodes` - moments of decisions - train station


### Composition
Composing 3d to view in 2d (flat monitor) like composition rules

- clarity and flow vs confusion
-  Vary silhouettes of the skyline  
- lines of sight  
-depth perception vs. real space



---

# Visuals


### Visual Language
- develop & maintain visual language consistency in style: aesthetic.
- `Optimum complexity`
- modular

- gradient of visual complexity where the play space has less visual complexity and then as the space transitions to where players/enemies can no longer traverse (or where something visually important is) we increase it.


### Visual story telling
let content of story to draw image  (not style ! )
evaluating story:
- what matter from the story point of view (no details)
- what is interesting for story
- summary important details

### Environmental narrative (mise-en-scene)
- universal themes understood by all cultures > honor freedom lib injustice vengin survival
- `Symbolism` (ascending desc.)> stairs up (create narrative),
- `Expression`. world; Historical and cultural, inhabitant (znaki zamieszkania)
- `Mystery` (scene enrichment)
- `Novelty`
- `Foreshadowing` - showing goals

### Architecture

### Pattern analysis
oprocz dunkcji musza byc rzeczy ktore sprawią ze lvl jest naturalny a nie jak w girsach auromatycznym skinem. obvious.

# Gameplay


#### Physics and usable


#### divide to parts - `Gateing`
- gates / valves
- soft gates



- differentiate by usage
- type; stelth / combat / traversal / public
- public space / purpose spaces
- primary target (no deadends) vs. illusory targets vs. escalating (everywhere), vs bonus missions << structure
- opportunities for different playstyles  
- beginning and end




- level reuse
