### Waveforms:
Create sound in oscilator

|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|
Sin | Simple | Muted Warm Hollow Bassy |Flute Organ
Triangle| Simple few overtones  (not as full as square) | Pure, Dull | Chime, Organ
Saw wave | Complex excitements and bright at hi end in upper range. |  Full Harsh Bright | string
Square | Complex harmonics, full sound  Can be shape no other can| Hollow Harsh Brass ruddy | Horn
Square Pulse | Square with wariation in timing
Noise | very Complex many overtones. Hard Cutting  |Asymmetric | Noise

Smooth shape, smooth tone , hard; hard tone


### Filter
Shape sound and character of waveform

 if you low pass filter saw wave you will get sth like sin  

 |-|-|-|-|
 |-|-|-|-|
Lowpass |  Cut off High end freq (higher are filtered)  | (traditional ?) duller
Highpass | Cut off Low end freq  | (more esoteric ? )
Bandpass | Low + High  
Resonance | Peak before high cut. Add sharpness. | Laser zaps, Focused sounds  
Sweep | Move resonance center   
Key track | Low same but higher notes have higher filter (more open) frequencies / high-end on high notes  
Envelope | ie: Open and Close filter over time  
Cutoff frequency | Take out of focus  
Drive |   
Env2 Mode  |  how much filter env modulate filter ftreq  




### Envelope
How fast tur on and down. how much envelop impacts settings u can modulate: filters, pitch or frequencies

|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|
Attack | In (immediate in: drum / or long in) | How loud over time  
Decay | Out (loudness over time) After attack  | How loud over time
Sustain | Rest state after decay 0 - immediately stop even key down | Rest state
Release | how long will stay after trigger release  | Start Immediately after release



Examples :   
- filter envelope -   
- amplifier envelope -   
- frequency envelope -    
- pitch envelope -   
- pulse with modulation - shape square wave



### Modulation
using signal to shape aspect of sound over time
> Modulate Wave with additional waves

#### LFO (modulator)
> Low frequency oscillator generate waveform (e.g. sin) like oscillator and using it as control signal modulator

Examples :    
- source >> destination e.g. LFO can modulate filter freq  
- can create pitch vibrato
- pulse width modulation with  Square wave
