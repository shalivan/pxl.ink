# Basic course
`spawn sound at location` -  
Sound cue - for simple mix (can mix with same pitched sound with offset )  (mixer to mix , modulator to pitch, envelope )  
Can drag and drop waves   
Default condition - when out of source sound will stop !!!!
- Virtualization - play when silent. (reserve voice so expensive

  Attenuation in assets  

BP
- fade out
- play sound
- play sound at location
- re-triger


  type of sounds

  - local area (in place, loop)
  - music mix
  - general gameplay from seq (znmiana stanu)
  - voice (not stoping)

# UE4

new engine is called audio Mixer  

`source` is defined to be the thing in the audio engine which actually generates audio in the audio renderer.  
`Source Effects` - audio effect which applies to a single source. (a filter, a delay, an envelope, distortion,  ... )  
`Source Effect Chain`   use it among any number of sources.  

`Submix` - (Summing Busses or Auxiliary Busses) is simply a mix of individual sources (post spatialization and  distance attenuation) into a single buffer.

`Submix Effect`  


`Source Buses` and` Source Bus Effects`

------------
Stream 1:


### Convolution reverb
live reverb > convolution filter

submix is place where mixing sound and ui can add sound fx .
send fx are those who work only on part of eg: send in a fn of distance

HOW TO
1 wave file >> RMB create impuls responce  (settings: premixing volume)
2 create new submix effect type: convolution reverb presset > reference impulse ()
3 create custom atenuation > (in category attenuation submix send >> add list >> add submix as destination of send (and set how send behave in distance and ect...))



### Synestesia
NRT - to znaczy z ez dysku not real time ? or sth ?????/
stemps -  you can split audio to diferent layers of music

- perceptual laudnes s(bit dif than envelope) take in acoount
- on sets / laudness and changeig in loud
- consta que (hi and low like spectrum fft)
- bin : quantise a spectrum to buckets cause cannot have continous data


-double freq is ecpon growth so to visualise spectrum we must convert this log to human maping  (maped like this in constant Q)

HOW TO
(sound source in other actor than visualisations) in lvl BP some shit

Synestesia NRT >>> ref to `settings` and `audio file`
Synestesia NRT Settings >>>
   nr bands - ilosc sciezek
   nr bend per octave: - 12 (12 is number of poiano notes)
   starting freq : is 55 becaust its in  tune: A



### Sound fields
>Ambisonic is tryiong to represent sound with sound pressure around audoiopsphere. can be decoded with any speaker config.  not depend of speakers

to lock ambience with word
order:  
1 order relativley cheap but overal localisation
higher order specific location
