New engine is called audio Mixer

https://youtu.be/wux2TZHwmck - first stream   
https://youtu.be/yce2t85MJD8 - blend audio   




### Source
 Thing in the audio engine which actually generates audio in the audio renderer.  
Source Sound (which may be a SoundWave, a SoundCue, a Synth, etc.


#### Audio files

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/wav.png">

  Can drag and drop `waves`


##### cues
  <img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/cue.png">
  For simple mix (can mix with same pitched sound with offset )  (mixer to mix , modulator to pitch, envelope)  

  ---

##### BP
  - `fade out`
  - `play sound`
  - `play sound at location`
  - `re-triggers`


###  Source Effects

- pre-distance attenuation and pre-spatialization.

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/srcfx.png">

Audio effect which applies (a filter, a delay, an envelope, distortion,  ... )  to a single source ( SoundWave, a SoundCue, a Synth,)

<img  src="/src/ue/audio/srceffect.png">

.

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/srcfxchain.png">

**Source Effect Chain** - Add `Source Effect Preset` to chain. wich u can add to: SoundWaves, Cues, or components

`Set Bypass Source Effect Chain Entry ` -  

**An Envelope Follower & listener** - is Old or new @synersdthesia?

### Submix

- occur after distance attenuation and spatialization.


<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/submix.png">


mix of individual sources. place where mixing hapen into a single buffer.    (u can put audio fx on submixes )




**Submix Effect**



<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/submixfxp.png">


place where mixing sound and u can add sound fx .

- `send fx` - are those who work only on part of eg: send in a fn of distance (reverbm delay)
- `bin` : quantize a spectrum to buckets cause cannot have continuous data
- `stem` : segment of music  you can split audio to different layers of music
- Virtualization - play when silent. (reserve voice so expensiveDefault condition - when out of source sound will stop !!!!

# Start Analyzing Output
Audio analysis live.

uzywana chyba w niagarze ?? i jest BP do tego.


# Synesthesia
Toolset for audio analyses.

### NRT
<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/nrt.png">

Links the analysis algorithm settings to the sound wave being analyzed.
Maintains the results of analysis as a uasset.
Provides Blueprint function access to the results.

#### ConstantQ
  higher quality (hi and low like spectrum fft) double frequencies is exponential
 growth so to visualize spectrum we must convert this log to human mapping.  

`Get Normalized Channel Constant Q At Time`    

##### Perceptual loudness
 (bit dif than envelope) take in amount  

 `Get Loudness At a Time`  

#####  On sets
 loudness and changing in loud  

 `Get Channel Onset between Times`

# Sound fields
Encoding audio into in 3d space. Can use for source orientation lock ambience within word
`Ambisonic` is trying to represent sound with sound pressure around audoiopsphere. can be decoded with any speaker config.  not depend of speakers


import `ambix` file (but still .wav) but still can have 4 or more channels.  There are special tools to author them.

order:  
- 1 order relatively cheap but only for overall localisation
- higher order specific location

HOW TO
1. checkbox in wave that is ambisonic.
2. Enable spatialisation
3. in blueprint can set rotation of actor to infl. rot sound. https://youtu.be/wux2TZHwmck?t=5915

# Convolution reverb
A convolution filter.  (work on Impulse response. which u can record)  
Can simulate reverb or use recorded.


HOW TO:
0. record impulse wave
1. `RMB` on wave file: create impulse response  (settings: can set here premixing volume)
2. create new  `Submix Effect presets` of type: `submix convolution reverb presets` (settings:  reference impulse)
3. create `custom attenuation` > (settings:  `attenuation submix send` >> add list >> add submix as destination of send

# Modular Synth (component)


Modular Subtractive Synthesizer

Audio buses

`Note On` - Note 0-127 , velocity, duration


##### Synth bank

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/synthbank.png">
<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/synthwavbank.png">

You can store synths patches and samples in banks:   

`Set Synth Presset` - (synth ref>get from array> break> synthpresste)

<img align="right" src="/src/ue/audio/synthclip.png">

**Synth Clips** - ??

# Granular Synth (component)

Wave player playing (usually) small pieces of the file (called grains)   Each grain can have its own settings, so in this way, itâ€™s possible to play back dozens or even hundreds of audio grains from a single file all with different parameters.
