[Music](/music/)  


## Drum mechines

RT-808 - define hip hop   
RT-909 - define techno   


## Synthesizers
Create sound in oscillator based on waveform which is filtered and modulated.

[Circuit](/circuit/) - synth  
[Keystep](/keystep/) - keyboard

## Oscillator:
Create sound in oscillator: Smooth shape, smooth tone , hard; hard tone

|-|-|-|-|
|-|-|-|-|
Sin | Simple | Muted Warm Hollow Bassy |Flute Organ
Triangle| Simple few overtones  (not as full as square) | Pure, Dull | Chime, Organ
Saw wave | Complex excitements and bright at hi end in upper range. |  Full Harsh Bright | string
Square | Complex harmonics, full sound  Can be shape no other can| Hollow Harsh Brass ruddy | Horn
Square Pulse | Square with variation in timing
Noise | very Complex many overtones. Hard Cutting  |Asymmetric | Noise



- 1.00 Hz A frequency of one hertz means that a full oscillation (or cycle) happens once per second
- Pulse width - How long on top and how long down: The wave has its “fullest” sound at the center, where the waveform is symmetrical.

## Low Frequencies oscillator LFO:
Low frequency oscillator generate waveform (e.g. sin) like oscillator and using it as control signal modulator

Examples :    
- source >> destination e.g. LFO can modulate filter frequencies   
- can create pitch vibrato
- pulse width modulation with  Square wave

## Filter
Shape sound and character of waveform
- open, close
- resonance

 |-|-|-|-|
 |-|-|-|-|
Lowpass |  Cut off Highend frequencies  | (traditional ?) duller
Highpass | Cut off Lowend frequencies  | (more esoteric ? )
Bandpass | Low + High  
Resonance | Peak before high cut. Add sharpness. | Laser zaps, Focused sounds  
Sweep | Move resonance center   
Key track | Low same but higher notes have higher filter (more open) frequencies / high-end on high notes  
Envelope | ie: Open and Close filter over time  
Cutoff frequency | Take out of focus  
Drive |   
Env2 Mode  |  how much filter env modulate filter frequencies

-  if you low pass filter saw wave you will get sth like sin

## Envelope ADSR
How fast turn on and down. Determine how much envelop impacts settings. U can modulate: filters, pitch, frequencies, pulse with modulation(shape square wave), amplifier.

 envelope’s shape with each new note, some aspect of sound

|-|how long it takes for the envelope to  |-|immediate| long|
|---|---|---|---|---|
Attack | reach its peak at the start of a note | Hit and Hold  |  drums  | wind
Decay | decrease from its peak to the sustain level  | Hold | sharp change
Sustain | Rest state | Hold Rest state|
Release | decrease to its minimum level after the note is released | Immediately after release |

## Modulation
Modulate Wave with additional waves. Using signal to shape aspect of sound over time
