# Linear Algebra
Algebra: where symbols repleace numbers. Flat no bending cureves
`projective geometry` - points lines and planes, concept of `duality`  (rotation is translation with pivot in infinity)   

properties of vector spaces and matrices
study of straight lines involving linear equations.

## Functions

- **Addition**  - is like  offset (subtraction is addin negative number  (special case of adding )> a-b = a+(-b))
- **Multiplication** - is like scale (dividing is special case of multiplaing a/b = a*(1/b))

#### Lerp

https://youtu.be/YJB1QnEmlTs

- **Lerp** : `ov = Lerp(oMin, oMax, t)`
- **Inverse Lerp** :  `t = InvLerp(iMin, iMax, value)`
- **Remap** `ov = Remap(iMin, iMax, oMin, oMax, value)`


#### Eerp
- Reminder that you should use exponential interpolation, not linear, for multiplicative quantities~
- if you want to find the frequency, zoom level or scale, halfway between 2 and 8, then the right answer is 4, not 5
  - lerp( 2, 8, 0.5 ) = 5
  - eerp( 2, 8, 0.5 ) = 4
  - `lerp(a,b,t) = a(1-t) + bt`
  - `eerp(a,b,t) = a ^(1-t) bt`

#### Slerp
- Quaternion lerp for rotation


## Vectors

- **Sign** sign(x) - Direction :  unit vector: on 1 dim is one or minus one
 - signed distance, can be nagetive   (signed area, signed distance fields)
- **Lenrh** len(x) = abs(x) = Length/Magnitude


#### Equations

| Operation |||- |
|- | - | - |- |
|a+b| a+b - move b to tip of a. | Vector
|a-b |  a-b = a+(-b) | Vector
|Dual |a° | Vector
|Dot product |  a°b | Scalar  -1 - 1| 1 = similar, 0 = perpendicular - orthogonal (90°), -1 = opposite dir (180°)
|Cross product | AxB|Normal vector | Normal of plane created by 2 vec len depend on angle n  (only in 3 dimentions)
|Wedge product 2 vect | A^B   | Bivector | plane with orientation witch contain a and b. (magnitude and orient) Exterior |product > (similar to cross)   
|Wedge product 3 vect | A^B^C   | Trivector | Extruded bivector if vect are linearly dependent wedge = 0 ()
|Contraction product| a╜x = B,   a╜b = a*b | |dot in higher dimenmtion (how similar)
|Geometric product | ab = a╜b - a^b, aB = a╜B + a^B  | Real + Bivector| complex number inner(dot) + outer product(wedge,'cross') (plane) -
|Sandwitch product | axa^-1 |  Vector | Reflection
|Rotor | | | is rotattion by double reflection  (quaternion: vector i scalar  quaternion is vector len rotor )
|Quaternion | | Vector4 |

Quaternions, Dual quaternions, Exterior Algebra





## Matrices
`Tensor` - is like vector  written by components made of dot products of component vectors


Transform matrix

Storing data for transformation (no scale):

xx yx zx posx
xy yy zy posy
xz yz zz posz  
0  0  0  1

- scale & orientation is in 3x3 matrix
- scale is stored in length of 3 vectors.
- can multiplay matrix by vector to get vector & transform coordinate space

- xyzw  (if w=1 trans point if w=0 is vector so only local vector not taking pos in account)

Identity matrix (in word space orientation, when multiplying give same resoult)
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1  - extra row for non equidial

## Trigonometry
unit circle. - radious of 1

### Angles
degrees 0-360° - measure angles by how far we tilted our heads- observer viewpoint
radians 2πr ~6.283.. - measure angles by distance traveled - movers viewpoint - easier to doing a math in formula. some variables will work out nicley.

[VEX ORIENT pxl.ink](/orient/)
```
revolution rev 0-1 - 1 full circle = 1 rev = 1 turn = 1 rot = 360°

euler angle direction 3Vector
dihedral angle - is the upward angle from horizontal of the wings or tail plane of a fixed-wing air craft.

matrix3 m = i

```



## Rotation / orientation

Link to Houdini vex site

#### Rotate vec by angle
a = angle  
a > (cosa, sina)
b > (-sina, cosa)
v' = vxa + vyb

in rotation vector matrix
v' =
[cosa, - sina]
[sina, cosa ]

# Calculus
Mathematic of change, more abstract, (smoothly changing things involving derivatives, integrals, vectors, matrices, and parametric curves)  but using algebra to calculate. (newton, leibnitz).


#### Differential equations
Differentiation (różniczka): derivative of a fn.  > Instantaneous rate of change
Integration (całka): Integral of a fn. > Area under its graph

#### Derivative
pochodna

#### Integral
całka


# fn

#### Fourier
Fourier Transform: decomposing to freq. .  represents sampled signal as sin and cos
Fast Fourier Transform: recognizing symmetry

#### Laplace
Tel us both if sinusoids and exponentials are represented in the function  

divergence of the gradient of some function. so say you have a heightfield (like a 2d grid with a scalar quantity on that grid, defining height).

the laplacian of the height value at any given voxel, will be a scalar value that basically tells you what the rate of change in that voxel will be, if you flow along the height fields gradient.

when you're doing this on a volume grid there's a "discrete laplacian operator" that's basically just a kernel that approximates the real thing

so if u want to sort of guide the growth, you would want to basically define a divergence field (diverg of field '+' when go awa -" when go to this point , )to mix in or merge on top (similar to how u would guide a smoke/flip sim). basically you would want to find the directions you want to flow towards, compute the divergence of that, and then add that on top of your laplace values. but id have to know how the growth is being driven, to confirm if that would work

If you want it to get more interesting rather than your growth weight being just the laplacian you can do something like growthweight = laplacian * dot(volumegradient, vec) where vec comes out of some 3d noise or something


#### Monte-Carlo
random
statistical model with random and proportions to calculate values by takeing random samples.  (ie area )

gravity >
jerk is the ratoe of change in acceleration > accel (d²x/dt²) is the rate of velocity change > velo (v=dx/dt)is the rate of change of > position
derivat and integrals of eachother

velocity


$$v=ds/dt $$

acceleration

$$a=dv/dt $$



integrate gravity over time to get velocity > integrate again to get position

implicit equations vs parametric equations
- implicit
- parametric (fn) like sin

- 0-1 - % - Normalized
- -1-1 - noise distribution variation
- linear speed p=(t)
- square p=(t*t) (in range 0-1) reduce value
- square have odd and even fn
- easing filter tweening fn (same)

```
out RangeMapin,inSttart,inEnd, outStart, outEnd(
  {
    out = in-inStart; // Puts in [0,inEnd=inStart]
    out /= (inEnd=inStart);
    out = ApplySomeEasingFn(out); // in [0,1]
    out *= (outEnd-outStart); // Puts in [0, outRange]
    return out + outStart; // Puts in [outStart,outEnd]
  }

```


square is expensive !

**Pow**
- is troche expensive
10x faster:
```
FakePow(x,2.2)= (.8*x^2) + (.2*x^3)
FakePow(x,2.6)= (.4*x^2) + (.6*x^3)

```

smoothstart
```
x = t*t //quadratic
x = t^3 // cubic
x = t^4 // quartic
x = t^5 // quintic
```
Smooth Stop
- deceleration
- flip square filp  
```
x = 1-(1-x)^2 // small jerk almost linear
x = 1-(1-x)^3 // fast stop
```
Can mix
```
x = mix( SmStrt2,  SmStrt2, 0.2); // 2.2
x = mix( SmStrt2,  SmStrt2, 0.6); // 2.6

```
