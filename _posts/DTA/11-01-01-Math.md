# Linear Algebra
`projective geometry` - points lines and planes, concept of `duality`  (rotation is translation with pivot in infinity)   

properties of vector spaces and matrices
study of straight lines involving linear equations.


## Vectors

#### Equations

| Operation |||- |
|- | - | - |- |
|a+b| a+b - move b to tip of a. | Vector
|a-b |  a-b = a+(-b) | Vector
|Dual |a° | Vector
|Dot product |  a°b | Scalar  -1 - 1| 1 = similar, 0 = perpendicular - orthogonal (90°), -1 = opposite dir (180°)
|Cross product | AxB|Normal vector | Normal of plane created by 2 vec len depend on angle n  (only in 3 dimentions)
|Wedge product 2 vect | A^B   | Bivector | plane with orientation witch contain a and b. (magnitude and orient) Exterior |product > (similar to cross)   
|Wedge product 3 vect | A^B^C   | Trivector | Extruded bivector if vect are linearly dependent wedge = 0 ()
|Contraction product| a╜x = B,   a╜b = a*b | |dot in higher dimenmtion (how similar)
|Geometric product | ab = a╜b - a^b, aB = a╜B + a^B  | Real + Bivector| complex number inner(dot) + outer product(wedge,'cross') (plane) -

## Matrixes
`Tensor` - is like vector  written by components made of dot products of component vectors

# Calculus
smoothly changing things involving derivatives, integrals, vectors, matrices, and parametric curves,



Differentiation (różniczka): derivative of a fn.  > Instantaneous rate of change
Integration (całka): Integral of a fn. > Area under its graph

#### Derivative
pochodna

#### Integral
całka


# fn

#### Fourier
Fourier Transform: decomposing to freq. .  represents sampled signal as sin and cos
Fast Fourier Transform: recognizing symmetry

#### Laplace
Tel us both if sinusoids and exponentials are represented in the function  

divergence of the gradient of some function. so say you have a heightfield (like a 2d grid with a scalar quantity on that grid, defining height).

the laplacian of the height value at any given voxel, will be a scalar value that basically tells you what the rate of change in that voxel will be, if you flow along the height fields gradient.

when you're doing this on a volume grid there's a "discrete laplacian operator" that's basically just a kernel that approximates the real thing

so if u want to sort of guide the growth, you would want to basically define a divergence field (diverg of field '+' when go awa -" when go to this point , )to mix in or merge on top (similar to how u would guide a smoke/flip sim). basically you would want to find the directions you want to flow towards, compute the divergence of that, and then add that on top of your laplace values. but id have to know how the growth is being driven, to confirm if that would work

If you want it to get more interesting rather than your growth weight being just the laplacian you can do something like growthweight = laplacian * dot(volumegradient, vec) where vec comes out of some 3d noise or something


#### Monte-Carlo
random
statistical model with random and proportions to calculate values by takeing random samples.  (ie area )



#### Gerstner Waves

gravity >
jerk is the ratoe of change in acceleration > accel (d²x/dt²) is the rate of velocity change > velo (v=dx/dt)is the rate of change of > position
derivat and integrals of eachother

integrate gravity over time to get velocity > integrate again to get position
