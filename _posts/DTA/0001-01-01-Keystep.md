# Sequencer / Arp

## Sequencer mode
- knob 1 - chose seq
- knob 2 change division / (with shift wait to release shift)
- time division (how many in one click)


normal mode
- stop is LED

##### Record mode:
- click `redcord` red led appera (`shift`  + `record` append)
 - key step one by one
 - **record pause**: click `tab` to record pause
 - **linked notes**: click `key` and `tab` while clicked
 - **legato notes**: tab and notes, a, b, c... (slide to next node)  
- stop after finish
- play to play  (`play` + `shift` - play from begining)

(shift + stop while playing delete nodes from seq ??? !)


## Chord node
Hold `Shift` + `hold` and play up to 16 notes (can be one by one). U can record chords. (cannot store in bank)

## Arp mode
play every key in loop


### Transpose / Play Keys
can play both to 2 devices   

transpose- `Shift` + `- oct`  

play -`shift` + `+ oct`   


## Style

- gate - shift + key (not working with linked and legato )
- swing - shift + key


Reset - `Oct+` and `Oct-` `while powering up` -  You should have an additional LED pattern, release the buttons once it's over. This will also reset your global parameters (the ones you set into the MCC).
