## Divergence

Measure of imbalance. Scale component is using pressure field  
Incompressible fluid - have not "scale factor" still have : swirl , shear and translate factors

Divergence |  |
--- | --- |
- |  Clump them together.
0 | For Incompressible fluid
+ | Cause particles to spread out


##  Viscosity
Measure of its resistance to deformation. All fluids are viscous somehow.

Viscosity | value at CentiPoise (at room temp ~21°C (70°F)) |
--- | --- |
Water | 1
Milk | 3
Motor Oil  SEA 10 | 85-140
Motor Oil  SEA 30 | 420 - 650   
Motor Oil  Castrol | 1000
Honey | 3000- 10 000
Chocolate | 25 000
Ketchup| 50 000
Mustard | 70 000
Sour Cream | 100 000
Peanut Butter | 150 000 - 250 000  
Sanitary Silicon | 5M - 10M


##  Surface tension
Tendency of liquid surfaces to shrink into the minimum surface area possible.

Property of warte molecules that are attracted to each other (cohesion). it is on surface, where molecules have space to stronger their bonds forming a tension that is absent in rest position. Measured in: **Pa * s**.  
Creating the surface pressure field. Fight against gravity trying to put particles in to drop.   
Function of curvature of shape. It try minimise it where is bigest.  Create oposeing forces on large changind curvature.
Sphere have no surface tension.


|Surface Tension|lo|
|-|-|
48 | more motion |
200 |
48000 | less motion, prevent fall,  tend to min.

Blurring shape.
- `Adhesion` - menisk wklęsły     
- `Cohesion` - menisk wypukły
