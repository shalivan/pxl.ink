# Camera

## Shutter Speed
Exposure time in s.

|s |  | |
|--- | --- | --- |  
|1/4000-1000 | Fast | Freez Motion, Less light
|1/250 |medium |
|1/60-125| medium
|1/15-30| slow noc
|1/2 | | Blurs Motion, More light
|>1




## Aperture
- `f-ratio` is Focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil. f/4 big hole - f/16 small   
-  `f-number` is reciprocal of the relative aperture f/N Determines the depth of field  
- `f-stop`  



#### EV sunny 16
-  More or less each stop in aperture increase (i.e., decreasing the f-number), the exposure time has to be halved:
iso `100` shutter `1/100` , iso `200` shutter `1/200`, iso `800` shutter `1/1000`  
- Values for direct sunlight apply between approximately two hours after sunrise and two hours before sunset, and assume front lighting. As a rough general rule, decrease EV by 1 for side lighting, and decrease EV by 2 for back lighting.


f/N | Conditions | Shade | Size | DOF |
--- | --- | --- | --- |   ---  |  
f22 | Snow | |	° | Sharp Image - ∞  |
f/16 | Sunny | shard shadows |	&#9900; | Narrow
f/11 | Slight Overcast | soft shadow  | 	&#9900;		|
f/8 | Overcast | minimal shadow  | 	&#9675;	|
f/5.6 | Heavily Overcast | no shadows |  	&#9675;
f/4 | Rain/Shade/Sunset | | &#9711;	| Wide
f/2.8 | Dusk | | &#9711;	| More DOF / Shallow distance

#### EV
Combinations of shutter speed and f-number  EV = log^2 * (aperture^2/shutter speed s.) Each increment of 1 in exposure value corresponds to a change of one stop EV100 = ( log2(Aperture² / (Shutter Speed) * 100 / ISO) )  

- `EV`  - Eye 20 f-stops / best cams 16 / DSLR - up to 13  


## ISO
In modern cameras dont have connection with noise level

High ISO:  
- Increase image brightness
- Decrees dynamic range
- Decrees tonal detail and accuracy

High ISO use case if u need:  
- Short shutter speed (motion blur concerns)
- Smaller Apertures (DOF Concerns)



# Lens





- `Standard lens` - change image while focus change.  
- `Still lenses primes` - without zoom are more stable, and can compensate image on focus change to maintain stability. Zoom lenses are hard to make  
- `Tilt shift lens`. A tilt shift lens distorts perspective, making things look smaller than they really are—almost as if they are toys.

**Nodal Point** of the lens (or more correctly, the entrance pupil) can be considered as the point at which the rays entering the lens converge. It can also be considered as the center of perspective of the lens or the apparent pupil.


## Focal Length

`Focal length` how much lens will be zoomed. (distance from film to  center (?? aperture))  DIVIDE BY:  f number (diameter of smallest hole)  
f=135mm / 2.8 f-number = 48.2mm  


Focal Length (mm) | -  | Usage | Cons | |
--- | --- | --- | --- | -- |
8-24 | Ultra Wide, Angle Fisheye | Architecture | Distort facial features, and perspective
24-35 | Wide Angle |
35-70 | Standard  | Closely reproduce what eye see || Human eye ~50
70-105 | Mild Telephoto  | Portrait |
105-300 | Telephoto |   |
300+  |  Extreme, Macro  |  Wildlife | Cons: Large f-num |  Far away so flat

##  Aperture
How much light.
Lenses will list a maximum aperture on the barrel, indicating the maximum width a lens aperture can open


## Depth of Field


## Image characteristic

correct through distortion and aberration maps provided by producent   

- `Bokeh` -  Quality of out of focus highlights and rest of image (can be falloff (smooth), even or inverted falloff (old styled))
- `Chromatic Aberration` - Caused by Dispersion. diff in speeding of different light lengths  (on big highlight or out of focus areas)   blue is bend more strongly than G
- `Spherical Aberration` - Ghost Glow (soft image on sharp mixed error) when wide open  hard to make inside and out same point of focus  
- `Distortion` - Most in super wide  (barrel distortion) or long (pincushion) lenses. (Difference in magnification between center and outside edges)
- `Sharpness` -
- `Lens Flares` (inner reflections in lenses depend on arrangement in lens construction)
-`Vignetting` -
- Micro contrast  




## Crop Factor Sensor
35 mm - full frame  

in full frame cam is better shallow dof



# Film
Places where is lot of light  chemicals form crystals and film become less transparent to light resulting negative.

Film response to light not linear way, (CCD can produce it), but most films have s-curves and we can recognize them by specification of film.  In film curve we have more detail in curves, more realistic. !!  (nice roll of in bright)

- closeup for emotions
- wide for intor and wide action

## Cinematography
https://chrisbrejon.com/cg-cinematography/appendix-1-guerilla-render-in-production/

### Camera  
   - Depth, Framing, Cropping, FOV
   - Avoid unnecessary moves, unwanted obj cutouts.   
   - `Depth of Field` `Grain` `Bloom`

### Editing
   - J cut - sound precedes the cut  - smooth scene introduction
   - B-Roll - video footage that sets the scene, reveals details, or generally enhances the story
   - Eye Trace - being aware of where the audience's eyes are looking
   - 180 axes of action indicate on the screen
   - 45 Degrees at least when 2 cuts showing same obj
   - It’s easy to cut between close and wide angles
   - Cut on Motion / Cut on Similar Elements

### Trailers
more filmmaking / performance than gameplaying .
- visual feedback  (how easy is to see change and understand)
- camera distance
- number of objects - Readability
- intentionality of shots
- Audience familiarity with subject. or required knowledge

Direction / cameras / puppeteers
- are u capture as player or 3rd person
- you can eye trace for shot cuts: u don't have to move your eyes to much
- cam movement can a character. Speed of camera tells a lot character
- controllers are best for slow movements
- use metronome when playing to the music     

Hollywood scenario:
- introduction
- reviel early
- vfx shotwith music
- character hopefully looking
- quick slide show
- clip of sth bad
- vfx shots
- scene with doubt about main character fate
- vfx money shot
- title
