[Music](/music/)  
[Synth](/synth/)  




- delete pattern not set tempo to 180
- side chain tab looks unused a lot of space
- abilities to preview last save difference (shift + session)
- delete all knob manipulation recordings (shift + clear )
- set start length (not always from 1 note let you nudge notes more ferally)
- able to nudge one note (there is a place in nudge mode)
- set gates length not only in record play mode
- slight color difference on sample swap (to know which are uses)
- Shift duplicate  - move (now its slow)
- remember sample names in software (bug)

## Macros  


Combine up to 4 settings  in top knobs 1-8



#### Macro for drums
fixed

|||
|-|-|
1/2 | Static pitch
3/4 | Decay envelope time
5/6 | Distortion
7/8 | Filter

#### Macro for synths examples:

Default:
1. Oscillator parameters
3. Envelope parameters
5. Filter parameters
7. Modulation and FX parameters


Example2:
1. Cutoff EG intensity  
2. Cutoff  
3. An intelligent transition of Resonance / Noise / Overdrive (depending on the patch, sometimes without Noise or Overdrive)  
4. first 50 % is for Attack Time / second half of the knob sets Release time (so you can smoothly morph a lead sound into a pad)
5. Vibrato, EFX Dry / wet / also chorus  
6. Performance Knob: LFO speed / intensity, OSC Tune
7. Volume / Amount of Noise  
8. Oscillator Morph functions. Wavetable Positions, Oscillator A/B Ratio  


#### Set up in editor

- seto knob to 0
- set mini settings
- change knob to max
- change depth to where max should be (positive depth)


---

## Oscillator
2 mininova oscillator engines.

> Default 1 osc. > can detune adding second oscillator and mix them on `mixer`



#### Oscillators  
`Waveform` - wave shape  
`index` -  pulse width index ?
`Interpolate` -      
`Cents` - tune?     
`Semitones` - up or down on octave (have multiple octave playing one note)    
`VSync` - depth ?     
`Density` - detone ?   
`Detune` -  

#### Mixer  
`Osc1` -  
`Noise` -  
`Ringmode` -  
`PreFX`, `PostFX` -  

---

## Filter

#### Filter
`Lowpass`,  `Highpass`, `Bandpass`  - cut right, cut left, both  
`12dB`, `24dB`  - cutoff slope. Greater value sooner cut off  (higher freq pass through)  
`frequency` - how much to cut off filter   
`resonance`    
`Q norm`  

#### Mod
`Key Track` - change freq depend on how high note is
`Env2 > Freq`   



#### Drive

`Drive` - amplify going in to filter. dif types  (bit crush, rat reduce)
Q1 / Q2 -  where to apply  

---

## Envelopes
Set Attack decay sustain release

1. Amplifier  
2. Filter  
3. Extra one  (you can  conreol by macro ) normally attack   

Velocity - how much have

---

## LFO

1. LFO 1
2. LFO 2

#### LFO
`Slew` (as portamento or glide for LFO wave ) limits how quickly wave can cahcnge value  
`Phase` - tels LFO where in the wave to start

#### Rate / Delay
`Rate` - (can sync to temp )  
`Delay` - (can sync to temp )with fade modes   

#### Delay Triger
`singiel` / `multi` -

#### Sync style
`free` - not synced  
`Key Sync` - start with new key push

#### Settings
`One Shot` / `Common`-

#### Fade mode
`fadein / out / gate in / out`

---

## FX

`Distortion`    
`Chorus`    
`EQ`    

---

## Settings

---

## Modulation Matrix

-------

# Circuit

#### `notes`
 - Play  

#### `velocity`
-   (how hard is press) nie wszystkie mają głośność  

Fixed Velocity is enabled by pressing Velocity 6 while holding down Shift 19 . Fixed Velocity
is confrmed by the Velocity button illuminating white while Shift is held down

#### `gate`
-  ile nut trwa dzwiek  

#### `nudge`
-  Cały pattern do przodu albo do tylu  

Remember that when using Nudge with Patterns of less than 16 steps, the effect of Nudge is
restricted to the Pattern length. Steps outside the Pattern length will be unchanged.


#### `length`
 - Dlugosc sekwncji  (ilość nut)  

#### `patterns`  

#### `mixer`
 - Mute  

#### `fx`
-  delay -{up}, reverbs - {bottom}   (global)  

#### `side chain`

-  on sustain things . will react to drum 1
right white knefels to more effect cutoff taki

### Scales:
musical notation since the middle ages. So, the list goes: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian

pitch from left to right


|32 | Chromatica (12 keys) | C |C# |D |Eb| E |F |F# |G |Ab| A |Bb | B |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
17 | Naturl Minor | C|| D|Eb|| F| |  G |Ab| | Bb
18 | Major | C ||D ||**E** | F| |  G| | A ||B
19 | Dorian | C ||D |Eb||  F||   G || A| Bb    
20 | Phrygian | C | C#||Eb||  F ||  G |Ab| | Bb    
21 | Mixolyduan  | C ||D ||E | F ||  G || A| Bb    
22 | Melodic Minor | C|| D |Eb|| F | | G || A|| B
23 | Harmonic Minor | C ||D |Eb||  F| |  G |Ab| || B   
24 | Bebop Dorian | C|| |Eb| E|  F||   G | |A| Bb  
25 | Blues  (6)| C |||Eb||  F | F# |G | || Bb   
26 | Minor Penatotonic  (6)| C |||Eb||  F|F# |  G || | Bb    
27 | Hungarian Minor | C ||D|Eb||  | F# | G |Ab| || B
28 | Ukraninian Dorian | C|| D| Eb|| | F# | G || A| Bb   
29 | Marva| C |C# || |E | | F# | G| | A ||B  
30 | Todi | C| C# || Eb||  | F# | G |Ab| || B  
31 | Whole Tone  (6) | C ||D|| E|| F#|| Ab|| Bb   

**Root Note** - niebieski u góry  - `Tonic note` - is the first scale degree. It is the tonal center and is the most stable note. Most often music ends on tonic because it's a good resting point and gives a sense of finality. This is possibly the easiest note in a scale to remember because it is one of two notes most often called by it's scale name.

we can shift this roote notes. poinmt is to have half and full steps in same way

ONE KEY to next is half step
make not sharp or flat to shift it

`major scale` - bazowa   

mozesz budowac triady na roznych skalach
major triad, minor triad, diminish triad, augumented rrtriad


### Tricks:
- Shift + octave up  - transpose whole octave pattern up

# Setups









---




- piano LFO 1 > destination: freq
- Source LFO +/- . Jak zmieniamy depth to 30 i -30 brzmi tak samo
- Source LFO + .
  - depth 20 .> 1/3
  - depth 25 > 1/5
  - depth 30 > interval of octve  (destinantion 1/2pitch)
- source: velo > destination LFO rate. give random
- LFO change another LFO: LFO 2 +/- , destination: LFO 1 rate destination2: Osc 1 Pulse Width   




- filter cutoff - bring in out
- Env2mod - how filter env  / lead arpeggio to softer sound
- Amplif and filter env attack
- Amplif and filter env release
- (lfo speed, modulation depth , distortion level, oscillator pitch...  )





- you can use wavetables
- trick (modulate index with LFO)
