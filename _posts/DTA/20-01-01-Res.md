# Resolutions
### Napkin math res  

`1024^2`
- 1 048 576  pixels   

`4096^2`
- `16 777 216` 16 mil pixels   =  ... mb  
- `4096^2` pix = `33 550` points - `500` frames (~`16` sek)
- 4k normal map at 80% UV usage can contain normal data from ~13.5m triangles at a density of one triangle per pixel.

`Lidar` - geotif file points 1 per meter is highest you will find



# Color space Conversion 


- sRGB - on monitor looks like even distribution but is not / math in sRGB is not working
- linear - look vanished   
- 19% of light intensity is perceived by us as half . (and 50% of sRGB is 21% linear so after gamma applied is appealing and natural for eye)


### sRGB 
- mid gray in middle (perceptual display of blacks)
 sRGB - 2.2 Gamma    (1/2.2=0.4545)

Because our eyes is more sensitive to differences in darker colors than brighter, the **darker parts gets more room** in the small 0-255 value space.
- For Color / Albedo


### Linear RGB
- image is brighter (black are crushed into small range)
- Linear space value (0.5) converted to a gamma space rgb value: `0.5`^(1 / 2.2) = ~0.73 * 255 = `186`

In linear the **brighter values are as important as the dark** ones.
- Quality of 16-bit linear is about equal to 12-bit sRGB.
- Mid grey 18% after gamma look like 50%
- For math, to get linear dependencies along gradient

sRGB to Liner
Gamma To Linear
- 255 * POWER(gammavalue / 255,2.2)
```cpp
if (sRGB <= 0.04045) 
	{ 
	linearRGB = sRGB / 12.92; 
	} 
else 
	{ 
	linearRGB = pow((sRGB + 0.055) / 1.055, gamma);
	}
```



Linear to sRGB 
Linear to Gamma
- 255*POWER(linearvalue/255,1/2.2)
- pow(@linear, 0.4545);
- pow (x, 0.4545) is a bit cheaper 'cause there's no division involved. 1/2.2 is 0.45
```cpp
if (linearRGB <= 0.0031308) 
	{ 
	sRGB = 12.92 * linearRGB; 
	} 
else 
	{
	sRGB = 1.055 * pow(linearRGB, 1.0 / gamma) - 0.055; 
	}
```

# Quality

`bpc` -- bit per channel  
`pbi` - bits per image  

**Bit depth** - The number of bits per pixel, sample, or texel in a bitmap image (holding one or mode image channels)
- 8 bit - what monitor can show 
- 16bit - enough

# Formats

Formats meant for view or transports data. 

exr - fastest save, saved as linear - less compression - multi layer 
- **EXR** with zip << LOSE LESS: Standard 32 bit . largest  file nothing lost. perfect replication < hdri , cryptomats and sometimes displacement 
- **EXR with DWAA** - loose precision of highlight < smaller faster  and can contain many images.
