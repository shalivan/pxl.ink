# VELLUM
>Vellum XPBD is expansion of grain PBD - position base dynamic. Points (like in pops) + constraints. Extinvtion of grain solver. For CPU / GPU.  

<!-- more -->

- Parameters are not global. **Size and density matter**  (if resolution of geo increasse >> mass chancge, constrains: number, input, itters.)
- Mesh resolution change: 1) mass of each point 2) number of constraints (properties/impact on iterations) (Mass > calculate varying)
- **UV direction** is importatnt! cloth behave depends on the grain of fabric. Keep UV straight (against grain or cross-cut) cause more or less  (weeknes of cross cut. garment will be more visible!!) in 45 degree will collapse not stiff.  (Enable Warp and Weft)
- **Thickness** not bigger than point distance. (Visual thickness param on constraints or solver or postprocess)
- You can write initial attribs to points of geometry like velocity  
- You can enter solver and manage forces inside **work with POP forces**

## `[Vellum Solver]`

**GEOMETRY**     
**CONSTRAINT**    
**COLLISION**

stress - estimated work per constraint

### Comon

`Velocity Damping` -   
`Staic Friction`  - tarcie 0.5 mało / 10 dużo i przywiera  


`Substeps` - (best but most expensive) How many times peer fram simulation take place  More expensive, but gives a better solve - especially for higher stiffness values. Increase 5+ for `grains` (when incresed you can try to decrease cosntr iters)  
`Constraint Iterations` - Increase for higher stiffness value to control excessive deformations - great for cheaper solver at high resolutions  
`Smoothing Iterations` -  to smooth out errors of excessive deformations, or constraint errors (when settings are bad) apply ioon dist constr. and chip (Jacobi style solve like grain) but make less stiff  


`Collision Passes` - Uses with the Detangle sop or complex collision (lower frequency iterations) - complicated and expensive - increase when collisions are fighting against constraints or other collisions!! However, its probably better to increase substeps and decrease constraint iterations for a more accurate solve - and to reduce load on the constraints - but is more expensive  


### Advanced

- first order integration - less acurate . cheap. simple / artefacts for linear motion  (dampness energy)  
- second integration - loose less energym, fewer iteration , sometimes cause bounce ie with collision  




```
stress to high:  
- up substeps - decrees changess rate . Try it first
- constraint itter - more time to solver what is correct postition
```



##### Advancde
**Second order** is more precisem, but canhav issues on colllsion, (bounce) if that turn on max accel

# Nodes

### `[Vellum Object]`
create object
### `[Vellum Source]`
Create frame can import obj everth frame by emition type like particles

# Source
### Import:
- SOP Path + Constraint Path can be `[Vellum Constrain]`  

#### Forces
Drag - if stuff in simulation have to much energy you can increse drag !!!!   

```

### Export:

### `[DOP Import Fields]` SOP
Usualy u have 2 of this connected to VellumI/O with geo an constraints objects.  
- DOP node from: `VellumObject`


##### Import:
  - **Field**  `ConstraintGeometry` // Import one field: only for constraints

---


# VEX
 `f@friction`  
`i@weld = -1` - same as stop  
`i@layer` layer shock on solver      
`v@v = 1;` - take speed directly from sop   



- **(prim)** `f@stiffness = 1000.0;` // set inputs            
- **(points)** `i@stopped = 0;`  /
- **(points)** `i@pintoanimaion = 0;` - break constraints      
- **Pop Wrangle**  `v@force`   
- **(points)** `s@breaktype = "stretchstress";`
