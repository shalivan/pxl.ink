# Solvers


## [Rigid Body Solver] DOP   

The RBD engine uses volumes and is useful for complicated, deforming, stacked, geometry.

1. OBJECT
  - `objects`  - rbdpackedobject  / rbdfractureobject / rbdobject (hero)
2. PRE-SOLVE
  - `pop forces` - apply pop forces in RBD    
3. POST-SOLVE
  - `sop solver` - will take geometry and transform it  

.
- Unable to enforce glue constraints between RBD Objects and Static Objects. You can work around this limitation by  (using constrained RBD Objects perhaps with some RBD Pin Constraint DOPs instead of a Static Object)


## [Bullet Solver] DOP
The Bullet engine offers simpler collision shapes and is suitable for fast, large-scale simulations.
Bullet likes pieces between 0.1 and 100 if you need smaller pieces, scale up and boost gravity proportionally  

1. OBJECT
2. DATA STREAMS

#### Subframes
Subframes: in global anim options  (global subs?) And Time is float turn off /  solver substeps (expensive when stacking obj)  / constraint substeps

####  przydaten sopy:
- Attribute promote
    - can calc center ! (compute aver 'P' )


Some of attributes can run over 'pieces':
  - Piece Attribute
  - Attribute Promote
  - Convex Decomp + assemble
  - Extract Centroid - can calculate actual center of mass.

#### Physical properties


`density` -    
`bounce` - how much energy conservation there is when two objects collide, this is multiplication between the two objects (e.g. sphere and the ground)  - 0 dont bounce      
`friction` -how difficult is to move object from rest. 0 - no resistance at all    
`dynamic friction` - multiplier for objects that are already moving    
`rotational stifness` - how much object will spin (how much object inherites rotation when hit by another object), 0 - means no rotation

# RBD Objects  


## [RBD Packed Object] DOP
Multiple packed pieces connect to 1op in solver.

- rotation for packed RBD :  dop angular momentum ? ??? or use POP torque !  
- geometry source can be fires tcontext geo


## [RBD Object] DOP  (Hero)


## [RBD Fracture Object] DOP

## [Static Object] DOP


## [Static object] DOP
For collisions after solver


# Constrains
required:
- `s@name` (point) - same as packed geometry point name.   
- `s@constraint_name` (prim)    
- `s@constraint_type` (prim)  

optional:
- `broken` (prim}group will be ignored by solvers on subsequent frames.   
- `next_constraint_name`  
- `next_constraint_type`   
- `i@propagate_iteration`	Detail   


## [Soft Constrain]
Use it a lot (ony bad case is lot of oscilation with small dumping witch require lot of substeps) not enough subs can cause unexpected damping  
- `stiffness` - (mass indep.) frq (nr of iter per sec) 1 > 100 stiffer > to infi. (will bend anyway, oyu can increase substeps)   
- `damping ration` - (mass indep.) 0 - bedzie oscylowac zanim wroci, 1 soft return to standard pos. Over >1 can incresse even more      

## [Spring Constraint]
- `strenth` - string constant (mass dep.)   
- `damping ` - damping coeficient (mass dep.)    

## [Hard Constraint]

## [Glue Constraint]
halftime - remove impact pwer (decay over time)  
propagation rate - 1  - will spread evn to naaighb.   
propagate iteration (same as solver iteration ovveride on other consrains) `-1 `< use default value /`1` propagate. Override it in SOP as prim attrib `propagationiterations`   

## [Slider Constraint]

# Collision

<img src="/src/rbd/rbd_collision_convexdecomp_01.png" width="800">



### Sphere Representation
For `bulletsolver` use **spheres collision representation**, fastest!. Not for one sided surfaces and sharp corners.

Setup:
- In RBD Object DOP change:
 - Bullet Data > check: [x] Create convex hul per set of connected primitives  

###  Convex Decomposition




.  


### ? Volume collision source
- mode: collision intersect to volume source
- proxy volume: vdb path  


### ? Mesh collision source

**for mesh collision source:**
- if its plane turn off volume based collision

# Proxy

Use `transfor pieces` SOP to move orginal over proxy.


<img src="/src/rbd/rbd_proxy_01.png" width="800">


.

**Packed geometry** - have `packedfulltransform` is 4x4 matrix transform (rot, trans, scale)

**Proxy** - Unpack transform from sim: `matrix m = primintrinsic(1,'packedfulltransform',0);` and copy to full geo






# VEX

`@name` - name pieces   
`v@v` - velocvity   
`v@w` - angular velo
`@mass` -
`i@active` - 0-1 0 is still in sim but static
`@friction` - 0 is ice.
`@bounce` -

STATES:  Key for states: Na spakowanegj geo przed solverem: //active = solve //  deforming: Anim > Pack  // animated: Pack > Anim  
```cpp

i@active=0;  
i@deforming=0;
i@animated=0;  
set i@active=0 after packed primitives in SOP
in dopnet create multiple solver
connect sop solver
in sop solver make group (box) selection of the geometry
animate the selection
attrib wrangle on the group to change i@active to 1

Key frame active  // node
Physical params  // Set Attributes in DOPs
Apply Data  // apply attributes in DOPs
```

## [Static Solver] DOP

## [SOP Solver] DOP
lets the DOP simulation use a SOP Network or chain of SOPs to evolve an object's geometry over time - dop geo impact and feadbacks and gve tou also import merge geo.

[Sops in dops TUT](https://diffusefx.com/2019/11/12/sops-in-dops-part-2/)

## [Multi Solver] DOP  
- multisolver is for pops (and rigid body)
