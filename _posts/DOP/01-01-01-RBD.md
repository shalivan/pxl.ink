# Solvers


## Rigid Body Solver  

The RBD engine uses volumes and is useful for complicated, deforming, stacked, geometry.

1. OBJECT
  - `objects`  - rbdpackedobject  / rbdfractureobject / rbdobject (hero)
2. PRE-SOLVE
  - `pop forces` - apply pop forces in RBD    
3. POST-SOLVE
  - `sop solver` - will take geometry and transform it  

.
- Unable to enforce glue constraints between RBD Objects and Static Objects. You can work around this limitation by  (using constrained RBD Objects perhaps with some RBD Pin Constraint DOPs instead of a Static Object)


## Bullet Solver
The Bullet engine offers simpler collision shapes and is suitable for fast, large-scale simulations.
Bullet likes pieces between 0.1 and 100 if you need smaller pieces, scale up and boost gravity proportionally  

1. OBJECT
2. DATA STREAMS

#### Subframes
Subframes: in global anim options  (global subs?) And Time is float turn off /  solver substeps (expensive when stacking obj)  / constraint substeps  

#### Substeps

# SOP


<img src="/src/rbd/rbd_sop_setup_01.png" width="800">

Geometry :
- pack!
- convex !
- `s@name` (point [packed])

Constraints:
- `s@name` (point) - name same as geometry. (`s@name = "piece" + itoa(@ptnum);`)
- `s@constraint_name` (prim)
- `s@constraint_type` (prim)


## States
Point attribute on packed SOP geometry:
- `i@active=1;` - Do the actual solve.     
- `i@deforming=1;` Animation before packing. (Will recompute collision every frame! )    
- `i@animated=1;`  Packing before animation.    


Can set up with `[RBD Configure] SOP` :
- <img src="/src/rbd/dop_sop_animated_03.png" width="400">

#### Animate:
To animate state ude SOP solver:
- <img src="/src/rbd/dop_sop_animated.png" width="400">
-
```
if (@Frame >21){
i@active=1;
i@animated=0;
}
```



#### Physical properties


- `@density` -    
- `@bounce` - how much energy conservation there is when two objects collide, this is multiplication between the two objects (e.g. sphere and the ground)  - 0 dont bounce      
- `@friction` -how difficult is to move object from rest. 0 - no resistance at all  - 0 is ice.  
- `dynamic friction` - multiplier for objects that are already moving    
- `rotational stifness` - how much object will spin (how much object inherites rotation when hit by another object), 0 - means no rotation  
- `@name` - name pieces     
- `v@v` - velocvity     
- `v@w` - angular velo  
- `@mass` -

# DOP

<img src="/src/rbd/rbd_solver_01.png" width="800">



# Objects  


## [RBD Packed Object] DOP
Multiple packed pieces connect to 1op in solver.

- rotation for packed RBD :  dop angular momentum ? ??? or use POP torque !  
- geometry source can be fires tcontext geo


## [RBD Object] DOP  (Hero)


## [RBD Fracture Object] DOP

## [Static Object] DOP


## [Static object] DOP
For collisions after solver


# Constrains

- Change `data name` in DOP to match input geometry @constraint_name.

#### Attributes

required:
- `s@name` (point) - same as packed geometry point name.   
- `s@constraint_name` (prim)    
- `s@constraint_type` (prim)  

optional:
- `broken` (prim}group will be ignored by solvers on subsequent frames.   
- `next_constraint_name`  
- `next_constraint_type`   
- `i@propagate_iteration`	Detail   

## Hard

## Soft
Use it a lot (ony bad case is lot of oscilation with small dumping witch require lot of substeps) not enough subs can cause unexpected damping  
- `stiffness` - (mass indep.) frq (nr of iter per sec) 1 > 100 stiffer > to infi. (will bend anyway, oyu can increase substeps)   
- `damping ration` - (mass indep.) 0 - bedzie oscylowac zanim wroci, 1 soft return to standard pos. Over >1 can incresse even more      

## Glue
halftime - remove impact pwer (decay over time)  
propagation rate - 1  - will spread evn to naaighb.   
propagate iteration (same as solver iteration ovveride on other consrains) `-1 `< use default value /`1` propagate. Override it in SOP as prim attrib `propagationiterations`   

## Spring
- `strenth` - string constant (mass dep.)   
- `damping ` - damping coeficient (mass dep.)    

## Slider


## Animate
Animate in SOP Solver attached to constraint net.

-
```
if (f@impact >= 1000) {
   s@constraint_name = '';
}
```

# Collision

<img src="/src/rbd/rbd_collision_convexdecomp_01.png" width="900">



### Sphere Representation
For `bulletsolver` use **spheres collision representation**, fastest!. Not for one sided surfaces and sharp corners.

Setup:
- In RBD Object DOP change:
 - Bullet Data > check: [x] Create convex hul per set of connected primitives  

###  Convex Decomposition




.  


### ? Volume collision source
- mode: collision intersect to volume source
- proxy volume: vdb path  


### ? Mesh collision source

**for mesh collision source:**
- if its plane turn off volume based collision

# SOP Solver
lets the DOP simulation use a SOP Network or chain of SOPs to evolve an object's geometry over time - dop geo impact and feadbacks and gve tou also import merge geo.

# POP Forces
- forces inside dop

---
# Proxy

Use `transfor pieces` SOP to move orginal over proxy.


<img src="/src/rbd/rbd_proxy_01.png" width="800">


.

**Packed geometry** - have `packedfulltransform` is 4x4 matrix transform (rot, trans, scale)

**Proxy** - Unpack transform from sim: `matrix m = primintrinsic(1,'packedfulltransform',0);` and copy to full geo

#### Deforming to animating extraction
To make sim more efficient. Can pick up scale
- `Extract transform` SOP

#  Fracture

## Boolean fracture
- special sop that provide constraints

## RBD Material Fracture
Voronoii ++
- glass - radial
- wood - boolean based - per piece can detect wood longer edge direction
-  
## Voronoii 2.0
- can do multiuple and `append to name` attribute.
-
## RBD Interior detail
- 1op - geo
- 2op - constraint  
- 3op - proxy geo

## RBD Cluster sop
Can Cluster from voronoii or boolean.

Set up `i@cluster` point attribute (on constraints)

But for static permanent connection




# ...


## Pack
`RBD Pack`
`RBD Unpack`


Some of attributes can run over 'pieces':
  - Piece Attribute
  - Attribute Promote - can calc center ! (compute aver 'P' )
  - Convex Decomp + assemble
  - Extract Centroid - can calculate actual center of mass.
  - rbdconstraintproperties SOP <<<< !!!!!! ?????
