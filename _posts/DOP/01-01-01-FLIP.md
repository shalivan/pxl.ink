Fluid Implicit Particle - Based on Navier–Stokes equations, implemented in OpenCL (can combine with vellum) hybrid solver. Fluid data is stored in the particles and only particles need to persist frame to frame Pressure projection step is done on a volume.   
[Basic flips](/src/hip/DOP_FLIP.hiplc)


   - Size sensitive: use units as meters.  
   - Time sensitive

# Solver

## [ FLIP Solver ] DOP

1. OBJECT - mandatory
   - `Flip Object` SurfaceSOP/ Particles /Flip Tank (narrowband)/   
2. PARTICLE VELOCITY  
   - `Pop VOP` / `Pop Wrangle` - @viscosity=x;   
   - `Pop Force`, `Pop Curve force` - (can merged)  
   - `Pop Solver` / `Sop Solver` - Access any sop (cmi)   
3. VOLUME VELOCITY    
   - `Gas Field VOP` - Volume from sim  (Illume Jeff II )  
   - `Source Volume` - Source as velocity field   
4. SOURCE    
   - `Volume Source` - Initialize source (SOP link to: `Flip Source` SOP) default will use op1 `Flip Object`    
   - `Heat Volume`  - Can spread temp (ie. lava cool rate)   
   - `Gas Temp Update`   
   - `Pop Color`  




### Substeps
- **timestep** - (divide 1 frame to few)  
- **substep** - (add steps in 1 frame) Mostly for fast moving fluid that collides with other objects and Surface tension. (no need in standard flips)



### Particle Motion


**Collision detection**  
  - **None**
  - **Move Outside Collision** fastest and provides the smoothest splashes, Not as accurate with fast-moving collision geometry. It is also the (only collision method that works with Volume Source based collisions).   
  - **Particle** method only works when a collision is represented by an actual DOP object.  (can use direction and bounce)

**Behavior** - Kill Collide Friction condition + ID, Age attribs
**Reseed** - Fix an uneven distribution due to numerical error. (Must be on for Narrow Band)    
**Separation** - Additional separation that prevent volume compression overwritten by velocity.

**Droplets**  - Particle below certain density turn to droplets more likely. (tend to combine)
- After blend back to fluid: Blend / Merge / Kill

**Vorticity** - Chaos & White water  
- **Preservation rate** - Decay value (how much vorticity should reman at end of the second) Retain swirling motion.  


### Volume Motion  

**Velocity Transfer** (Kernel)
  - **Splashy FLIP** -  Implemented with the newer method
  - **Swirly APIC** -  is not as noisy and turb. and keep vorticity better  
smoothing.

**Volume Limits**    
  - **Waterline** - (semi open boundaries)(above open, below close) it should be on water level.    
  - **Use boundary layer** - (adv waterline) (velocity volume - at volume boundaries) (surface volume control geo in boundary padding) if both not connected it will use warterline options. (Houdini 16 Masterclass)

**Collisions**   
- **Default velocity scale** - for Volume Source is 1.5, which will cause larger splashes by default, but for moving containers this should be set to 1.
- **Stick on collision** -  [viscosity free solutions!: ] ( simualte sth like (free slip condition) but inverse)


**Viscosity** - How much tend to be solid. Adhesive force which resist motion (lava). Measured in: (centi) Poise.    
- Enable in [FLIP solver] and set value at [Flip Object].


- **Slip on collision**  
  - 0 - Collider velocity. Can't slip - Sticky  
  - 1 - Fluid velocity. Slip on surface - Slide (opposite to: stick on collision)



|Viscosity|1|5-10M|
 |-|-|-|
||Water |Silicon|

`@viscosity`  - Control locally use  attribute on points.

**Density** - By default, the fluid has uniform density as set on the Physical tab of the FLIP Object.

**Air** - Enforce Air Incompressibility on the FLIP Solver. This feature prevents air pockets from collapsing.

**Divergence** - Measure of imbalance. Scale component is using pressure field.  

|Divergence|-|0|+|
|-|-|-|-|
 ||Clump them together | Incompressive fluid have not "scale factor" (have: swirl , shear and trans)| Cause particles to spread out



**Surface Tension** - Tendency of liquid surfaces to shrink into the min surface area.  (Require small scale but, In small scale it can be unstable > substeps)

- Blurring shape.
  - `Adhesion` - menisk wklęsły     
  - `Cohesion` - menisk wypukły

|Surface Tension|48| 200 - 48000 |
|-|-|-|
|| More motion | Less motion, prevent fall,  tend to min. surface area more


### Narrow Band    
- Work only with reseed  


---

## [ FLIP Object ] DOP

- **Particle separation** - Seed density. How far apart particles try and stay. Will change particles count.
- **Particle radius scale**  - actual radius of every particle    
- **Grid scale** - resolution of the volume voxels. Help preserve Volume. To low will lose informations.  

##### Initialize:

   - **Surface sop** -
   - **Particle field** -
   - **Narrow Band** -

##### Physical:
 - `Bounce`, `Friction`, `Temperature`, `Density`, `Viscosity` (if viscosity by attribute in solver is checked and there is point attribute at sop viscosity will be multiplied)


---
## [ Volume Source ] DOP
For sourcing fluids or vel fields   

##### Initialize:
   - Source FLIP - default path to `FLIP Source` SOP  
   - Sink FLIP - sink point  (size depend speed of sink)
   - Pump - for vel from volume. Import vel file.

`Input` - path    
`Name source volumes` -  volume name  


---
# Source

## [ FLIP Source ] SOP
Converts its input geometry into a volume that can be used to control simulations. i (for Volume Source DOP)


<img src="/src/flip/flipsource.png" width="406">


- inject liquid into a FLIP
- act as a sink in a smoke simulation.  
- volume operations set behaviour (add/overide velo)        
- velocity volumes source attributes - we can sample it from N or sth.  
- container settings - velocity

---


## [ Flip Tank ] SOP

`Points From Volume` (for source volume  DOP) // source from points (change[Initial Data] input to *particle field*).      
`Oceane Source` (for flip object  DOP) (particles(points)+volume for: sop path and surface volume) //  (change [Initial Data] input to *narrow band*) Fluid Tank ?    

`Limit Refinment iteration` - can remove glitches, use only in small scale (good for visc droplets ect...)    (particle fluid surface)

# Collisions
 Deforming Object shelf tool

**Volume Source based collisions**: Work only with  **Move Outside Collision** method for particle collisions, because the Particle method only works when a collision is represented by an actual DOP object.

**Move Outside Collision** is the fastest collision handling method and provides the smoothest splashes, however it is not as accurate with fast-moving collision geometry.

`static object` with collision mode to: volume sample {DeformingGeo shelf}   
- Enabling Collision Separation on the FLIP Object and setting this value to the Particle Separation or smaller will create a higher-resolution collision field
- Accurate velocities for moving collision objects are extremely important.
- {Deforming Object} shelf tool to set up deforming geometry as a FLIP collision object.
- SOP `Collision Source` -  interpolate deforming geometry, calculate point velocities, and create VDB. Usually used in conjunction with a Static Object DOP.

# Import simulation

<img src="/src/flip/flipimport.png" width="406">


## [DOP import] SOP         
Import Points  

`Particle Fluid Surface` - limit refinement if unstable. / Change surfacing > surface output > from surface polygons to Surface VDB !!
For emitting large numbers of particles, the Volume Source DOP can be much faster than the Particle Fluid Emitter DOP.

## [DOP I/O] SOP
Points + 4volumes. For further processing.    

`DOP Network` - path to DOP Node  
`DOP Node` - path to `Flip Object`    
Choose volumes from preset or import custom volumes     

## [Fluid Compress] SOP
before cache

## [Fluid Surface] SOP
to get fluid surface

# VEX
`i@stopped`   - You can stop the particles in a flip sim with  
`v@v` => vel  
`@viscosity` -


 ---




# Setups  

- **Viscosity** - Lava   
- **Surface Tension** - Deep drops, Crown Splash   
- **Suction** - Avoidance  
- **Divergence** -

## Micro
depend on velo, scale, grid size

- On solver:  
 - Sub steps up!! up 5+
 - On Surface tension   
 - Velocity transfer: Splashy >> Swirly  
- In self they reduce gravity. Gravity reduced in  Drip and crown to have small scale

#### Crown Splash

- Flip tank with boundary layer
- Surface tension: 48 more motion / 200 high value less motion for
- Grid scale // fat 2 / thin 1.5 (grid to create surface and measure curvature )
- you can blur curvature

#### Droplet
- Surface tension:  high 48000 to prevent fall down

#### Suction Fluid
Extension of surface tension.

- Pop wrangle: op2 antigravity (oppose gravity around object), inside have no gravity.  
- Gas field wrangle: op3 suction force. strength + gradient on distance sometimes you need to keyframe it  
- collision source on geometry (velocity, volume out) + interior exterior distance for gradient
strength and ramp in world units meters (outside )
.
- **! remember voxel size on collision source volume cretion. !!!!!!!!!**   
- narrow band needed as well !!!!!  

Values to animate:  
outside distance: big: good to pull from ground, smaller give better shape.  
strength: 120 000  anim > 480 000 keep inside

## Multiple solvers

##### Floating RDB
DOP>flipsolver>Volume Motion>solver change Feedback Scale from 0 to 1.  
 https://vimeo.com/116176349#at=158  
 https://youtu.be/JzxXjHgkIIc

```
Merge: rigidbody solver + flip solver
Check density of object (mass)    
Bullet solver with rdb object is working as well

## Velocity1
you can create `velocity field` > `source volume`


## Populate containers  
Can work with flips   
`Pump from ` - create volume velocity (like)
