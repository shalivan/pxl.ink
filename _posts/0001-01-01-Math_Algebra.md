# Linear Algebra
`projective geometry` - points lines and planes, concept of `duality`  (rotation is translation with pivot in infinity)




## Vectors

#### Equations
| Operation |||- |
|- | - | - |- |
|a+b| a+b - move b to tip of a. | Vector
|a-b |  a-b = a+(-b) | Vector
|Dual |a° | Vector
|Dot product |  a°b | Scalar  -1 - 1| 1 = similar, 0 = perpendicular - orthogonal (90°), -1 = opposite dir (180°)
|Cross product | AxB  |Normal vector | Normal of plane created by 2 vec len depend on angle n  (only in 3 dimentions)
|Wedge product 2 vect | A^B | Bivector | plane with orientation witch contain a and b. (magnitude and orient) Exterior |product > (similar to cross)   
|Wedge product 3 vect | A^B^C   | Trivector | Extruded bivector if vect are linearly dependent wedge = 0 ()
|Contraction product| a╜x = B,   a╜b = a*b | |dot in higher dimenmtion (how similar)
|Geometric product | ab = a╜b - a^b, aB = a╜B + a^B  | Real + Bivector| complex number inner(dot) + outer product(wedge,'cross') (plane) -
|Sandwitch product | axa^-1 |  Vector | Reflection
|Rotor | | | is rotattion by double reflection  (quaternion: vector i scalar  quaternion is vector len rotor )
|Quaternion | | Vector4 |
