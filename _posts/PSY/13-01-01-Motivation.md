#  Biological

`Impulses`, `Power`, `Achievement`, `Affiliation`
  Biological motives include hunger, thirst, the pursuit of pleasure, and the avoidance of pain

- Shot of dopamine is not needed,
- mind create tolerance for dopamine it recive.

## Neuroscience

- `directional` (such as directed towards a positive stimulus or away from a negative one)
- `activated` "seeking phase" and consummatory "liking phase."

 Dopamina

## Behavioral
Behaviorism is theory of motivation focused on how the results we’ve **obtained from past** behaviors shape our future behaviors (Environmental Shaped & Learned Drives) In this theory internal needs of individuals can be ignored. Reinforcement needs to be more than a one-off event.

- Positive Reinforcement
- Negative Reinforcement.
- Punishment.
- Extinction.

## Drive

- (ciekawosc?)   

Drive, in psychology, an urgent basic need pressing for satisfaction, usually rooted in some physiological tension, deficiency, or imbalance (e.g., hunger and thirst) and impelling the organism to action.



### Continuous Reinforcement
All responses are reinforced
happens when the desired behavior is reinforced each time it is observed. continuous reinforcement is the quickest way to get someone to develop a new behavior.

### Intermittent  Reinforcement

Some responses are reinforced

| |Interval (after time)|Ratio (after action)|
|--|--|--|
__Fixed__  Predictable | kill > loot spawn, stamina (building up high peak and quick drop)  | One more turn. clickers,  turn based building time (short post reinforcement pause)
__Variable__ Unpredictable |  public events (moderate study response pattern) | Gambling. Loot drops, Crit hits  (high stady response pattern, small bumps)


### Contingent
- `Not-Contingent` - not related to behavior (suprice gifts), not controled
- `Task-Contingent` - rewarding: `engagement`, `completion`, `perdormance`. Sense of progression - task releated motivate more contingent outcomes are not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.




### Feadback
feadback on action is reward  !!!
reward timeing and (un)certanity - immediate for success progress and choice
delayed feedback need stronger support
nitr geting rew u expect could become punishment   

`Representative Heuristic` - Time/Cost/Effort > Up expectation for reward . (Procedural like roguelikes play agianst it sometimes)  balanced economy   


##  Addictions
dopamine feadback  - (social media )  
slot machines  



- reward can be demotivating
- Unexpected reward are motivating
- Expectations. After bad luck we expect payout (gambling).
- Representative expectations - (Ngram colors in destiny)
- Loss Aversion: Something I have > Something I could have

#  Personal



Personalities
Personality traits OCEAN
Temperament
Myers-Briggs / 16 Personalities

[Personalities](/personality/)   



 which categories of goal (needs) motivate people,

Content theories    
 - **Maslow** - `Physiology` (hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.) > `Safety`/`Security`/`Shelter`/`Health` > `Social`/`Love`/`Friendship` > `Self-esteem`/`Recognition`/`Achievement` > `Self actualization`/`achievement of full potential`
 - **Two factors** - job satisfaction (motivators), while others (hygiene factors)
 - **ERG** - existence, relatedness, and growth,
 - **Barrett** - on consciousness !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Lyell's Impediments to Actualization  - Natural / unnatural addictions  & Self-Actualization  



`Autonomous` - (self determinate) vs. `Controlled` - (non self determinate) Illusion of control is as good as real contr.

## SDT
**Self Determination Theory**
basic need for autonomy   
 Depend on context and not account for all human behavior. Can shift by different framing. OLD:
 - `Intrinsic` -  (internal or inherent) motivation, Personal Gratification. last longer. rate higher! better (autonomy, agency, progression, feedback, opportunity). But can feel bad i.e. if you are obligated to your self  
 - `Extrinsic` - External. inspired by outside forces Rewards shape to do but risk of shifting motivation. Use when needed (money) But! can feel autonomous if enough choices. Goal oriented

 intrinsic motivation (volitional play) or extrinsic motivation (compulsive play) - "for fun" vs due to compulsion
(F2P game design and for gamification design much of game design in those spaces *relies* on compulsion loops and extrinsic rewards..)

| | |
|--|--|
Competence  |sense of progression, sense of being in control Interact with activities. everyone want be best
Autonomy | self expression or meaningful:  choice (not satisfy by chose)
Relatedness |  cooperation or competition. Rank relation. (knowledge where I fit)



 goal u set for yourself are stronger than goals set by someone else  extr / intrinsing

## MDT
**Motive disposition theory**

|  | ||
|--|--|--|
Implicit |  are implied but not directly stated |  wishes
Explicit |directly stated, leaving no room for uncertainty | desires



## SDT vs MDT




||MDT| SDT|
|---|---|---|
Theme of crucial need| Power| Autonomy
Hypotheses about the effects of need satisfaction | Matching hypothesis:` Motive × Environment` interaction predicts motivation and well‐being | Universality hypothesis: `Satisfaction` of basic needs has similar (positive) effects for everybody
Individual differences | `Want` - Needs as motive. Individual differences  | `Need` as requirements - No differences
Access to needs and measurement | `Unconscious`, indirect assessment: PSE, OMT |`Conscious`, direct assessment: self‐reports
Evolutionary basis | Variation in motive strength through learning | Basic needs are represented within the genome of every human being
Neurohormonal basis | Motives are associated with specific hormones | No explicit assumptions about neurohormonal basis of needs
Implicit vs. explicit | `Implicit` vs. `explicit motives` | NA
Hope vs. fear |Differentiation into `hope` and `fear` components of implicit motives | NA

## PENS
Player Experience of Needed Satisfaction
https://nickballou.com/posts/misunderstandings-of-sdt-in-video-games-part-1-basic-psychological-needs/

| PENS | ||
|--|--|--|
Competence  | Challenge, Easy to learn difficult to master  | skill: survival, crafting
Autonomy | Choice, Customization, Agency, Freedom, Control | your world, your creations
Relatedness | Connecting, Social grouping, Status feedback  | shared experiences, public canvases


## Gamer motivation profile

|Gamer motivation profile | High | Low |
|--|--|--|
`Community` | Teamwork - community driven sacrifice control   | Independence
`Competition`  | High conflict, duels social comparison | Non-adversarial - no ranks Cooperation
`Excitement` | Fast Paced, surprises |
`Destruction`| Chaos | No weapons, no explosions
`Completion` | Task oriented (Get all collectables) | Sandbox (most age stable motivation)   
`Power`| Level up, grind character / equipment    | Static level and flat progress
`Strategy` | Thinking ahead  |    
`Challenge`  | Practice, high difficulty skill based | Easy fun  
`Fantasy` | Being someone else  |    
`Story` | Scripted drama, character | Open Ended Plot
`Discovery` | Hidden curious explore   | Full exposed minimal unknow
`Design` | Customization | Expression  

Motivation GDC:  

Novelty - Fantasy/realism.  Build/explore  
Challenge - Skilled/No  Work/not work  
Harmony -  mechanics/context   cooperation/conflict  
Stimulation - single/multi   calm/thrill   



##  Emotion

Emotions @ motivations
Anxiety - to much
Apathy - not for me
Worry motivated
Arousal motivated
Boredom
Relaxation
Control
Flow

`Game Feel` - is it seem real, does mechanics allow us to do sth. feeling of competence and growth mastery   
`Interaction` - is positive

# Social

## Cultural

### FOMO
### Ikigai
- role in society




## Multiplayer
Guilds/ clans
Cooperation give chance for Positive externalities (benefit for others)

## Feedback

sounds satisfaing because of feadback. even small delay can  estroy effect


## Recognize  
if we know the meaning and can recogniz e interpret or understand

brain have idea and it must fit to reality. To meet expectations is important  
Illusion of control is just as much impact as real

rewards can be demotivated:

overjustification:  
- les interes dwawing if later no rewards
- les creaticve more prone to cheat
- les motivated if reward stop

(For kids short videos are worse than long because of shortening attention span)



central to game design
- addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation
-  motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.


```
##### Tips  
- show purpose before giving reward Goals must be `meaningful`! for players     '
- after meaningful actions clear goals. Why important
- show value / personalize
- more effort / time needed, greater reward expected     
- absence is like a punishment    
- intermitted intervals for forming habits  
- fixed ration to sense of mastery   
- variable ratio for excitement  
- reward is not an ending but starting point  
- help player feel being in control
- Illusion of control is as good as real contr. Loosing control can be mechanic as well: Stanley Parable.
