[Britannica explains:](https://www.britannica.com/topic/motivation/Observational-learning) No one theory is capable of explaining all that we know about motivational processes.  Some motives seem best understood from a biological viewpoint. Other motives appear to be learned. Still other motives are influenced by the cognitive processes in which we engage. Our interpretation of the events around us influences our future motivation.
- needs, wants or desires acquired through influence or may be generally innate. Conscious or unconscious
- most important reasons for actions or move forward in the decision-making process
- progression > stimulate brain > keep engaging:  [Experience > Flow / presence / immerse / engagement ](/ludology/)

#  Biological
Biological motives include hunger, thirst, the pursuit of pleasure, and the avoidance of pain
- Shot of dopamine is not needed,
- Mind create tolerance for dopamine it receive.  
`Impulses`, `Power`, `Achievement`, `Affiliation`

## Neuroscience
Dopamine  
- **Directional**- Directed towards a positive or away from a negative stimulus
- **Activated** - **Seeking** phase and **consummatory** "liking phase."

## Behavioral
Behaviorism - theory of motivation focused on how the results we’ve **obtained from past** behaviors shape our future behaviors (Environmental **Shaped** & **Learned** Drives) In this theory internal needs of individuals can be ignored. Reinforcement needs to be more than a one-off event.
- Positive Reinforcement
- Negative Reinforcement.
- Punishment.
- Extinction.

[Britannica - Behavioristic approaches to motivation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/motivation/Behavioristic-approaches-to-motivation)

## Drive (ciekawość)
Drive - in psychology, an urgent basic need pressing for satisfaction, usually rooted in some physiological tension, deficiency, or imbalance (e.g., hunger and thirst) and impelling the organism to action.

### Continuous Reinforcement
All responses are reinforced
happens when the desired behavior is reinforced each time it is observed. continuous reinforcement is the quickest way to get someone to develop a new behavior.

### Intermittent  Reinforcement

Some responses are reinforced

| |Interval (after time)|Ratio (after action)|
|--|--|--|
__Fixed__  Predictable | kill > loot spawn, stamina (building up high peak and quick drop)  | One more turn. clickers,  turn based building time (short post reinforcement pause)
__Variable__ Unpredictable |  public events (moderate study response pattern) | Gambling. Loot drops, Crit hits  (high steady response pattern, small bumps)

### Contingent
- `Not-Contingent` - not related to behavior (surprise gifts), not controlled
- `Task-Contingent` - rewarding: `engagement`, `completion`, `performance`. Sense of progression - task related motivate more contingent outcomes are not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.

### Feedback
feedback on action is reward  !!!
reward timing and (un)certainty - immediate for success progress and choice
delayed feedback need stronger support
nitr getting reward u expect could become punishment   

`Representative Heuristic` - Time/Cost/Effort > Up expectation for reward . (Procedural like roguelikes play agianst it sometimes)  balanced economy   

##  Addictions
dopamine feedback  - (social media )  
slot machines  

- reward can be demotivating
- Unexpected reward are motivating
- Expectations. After bad luck we expect payout (gambling).
- Representative expectations - (Ngram colors in destiny)
- Loss Aversion: Something I have > Something I could have

#  Personal
Which categories of goal (needs) motivate people.  [Personalities](/personality/)   


## Content theories    
 - **Maslow**
   - Physiology (hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.)
   - Safety / Security / Shelter / Health
   - Social / Love / Friendship
   - Self-esteem / Recognition / Achievement
   - Self actualization / achievement of full potential
 - **Two factors** - job satisfaction (motivators), while others (hygiene factors)
 - **ERG** - **Existence**, **Relatedness**, and **Growth**
 - **Barrett** - on consciousness !
- Lyell's Impediments to Actualization  - Natural / unnatural addictions  & Self-Actualization  




## SDT - Self Determination Theory
Basic need for autonomy.  Illusion of control is as good as real contr. Goals You set for yourself are stronger than goals set by someone else  extrinsic / intrinsic. F2P game design and for gamification design much of game design in those spaces *relies* on compulsion loops and extrinsic rewards..
- **Autonomous** - Self determinate
- **Controlled** - Non self determinate

Depend on context and not account for all human behavior. Can shift by different framing. OLD:
 - **Intrinsic** motivation - Internal or Inherent. "for fun"  Personal Gratification. last longer. rate higher! better (autonomy, agency, progression, feedback, opportunity). But can feel bad i.e. if you are obligated to your self  
 - **Extrinsic** motivation - External, Compulsive play "due to compulsion". inspired by outside forces Rewards shape to do but risk of shifting motivation. Use when needed (money) But! can feel autonomous if enough choices. Goal oriented.




## MDT - Motive disposition theory

|  | ||
|--|--|--|
**Implicit** |  are implied but not directly stated |  wishes
**Explicit** |directly stated, leaving no room for uncertainty | desires



## SDT vs MDT




||MDT| SDT|
|---|---|---|
Theme of crucial need| Power| Autonomy
Hypotheses about the effects of need satisfaction | Matching hypothesis:` Motive × Environment` interaction predicts motivation and well‐being | Universality hypothesis: `Satisfaction` of basic needs has similar (positive) effects for everybody
Individual differences | `Want` - Needs as motive. Individual differences  | `Need` as requirements - No differences
Access to needs and measurement | `Unconscious`, indirect assessment: PSE, OMT |`Conscious`, direct assessment: self‐reports
Evolutionary basis | Variation in motive strength through learning | Basic needs are represented within the genome of every human being
Neurohormonal basis | Motives are associated with specific hormones | No explicit assumptions about neurohormonal basis of needs
Implicit vs. explicit | `Implicit` vs. `explicit motives` | NA
Hope vs. fear |Differentiation into `hope` and `fear` components of implicit motives | NA

## PENS - Player Experience of Needed Satisfaction.  

|  | ||||
|--|--|--|--|--|
**Competence**  | Challenge | Easy to learn difficult to master  | skill: survival, crafting | Being in control Interact with activities.
**Autonomy** | Choice | Customization, Agency, Freedom, Control | your world, your creations | Self expression or meaningful choice  
**Relatedness** | Connecting | Social grouping, Status feedback  | shared experiences, public canvases | Cooperation or Competition. Rank relation. (knowledge where I fit)

Motivation GDC:  

Novelty - Fantasy/realism.  Build/explore  
Challenge - Skilled/No  Work/not work  
Harmony -  mechanics/context   cooperation/conflict  
Stimulation - single/multi   calm/thrill   



#### Challenge   
- chelenging task
- flow state > zom  
release neurotransmiters : `dopamine` `serotonin` `endorphins`
x

McGurk effect - take video of important context of hearing audio
book: `satisfaction`  Gregory Berns

#### Feedback  
nagroda   
sounds satisficing because of feedback. even small delay can  estroy effect


#### Recognize  
if we know the meaning and can recognize interpret or understand
https://youtu.be/qr0JMv2uYxQ

brain have idea and it must fit to reality. To meet expectations is important  
Illusion of control is just as much impact as real



##  Emotions

Emotions @ motivations
Anxiety - to much
Apathy - not for me
Worry motivated
Arousal motivated
Boredom
Relaxation
Control
Flow

`Game Feel` - is it seem real, does mechanics allow us to do sth. feeling of competence and growth mastery   
`Interaction` - is positive



FEARS WANTS & DEASIRES, change customer seek::: >> advent, affection , avoid new, belong, control, create, freedom, friend, good looks, learning, community, friends, luxury, nostalgia, participation, peace of mind, power, respect, reassurance,  revenge, romance ,safety, sexy , sec, sympathy, tension

# Gamification

- **structure** - structure around the content   - ponts levels achievments
- **content** -  

||Left brain||Right brain|
|--|--|--|--|
|Positive|**Development** and **Accomplishment** |**Epic meaning and calling** |**Empowerment of creativity and feedback**|
||**Ownership and possession** ||**Social**|
|Negative|**Scarcity** | **Loss & Avoidance**| **Unpredictability** and **curiosity**|

- **Epic meaning and calling** - narrative, meaning
- **Accomplishment** - more milestones, overcome challenges, leaderboards
- **Ownership and possession** - Farmville, hub building
- **Scarcity** -
- **Empowerment of creativity and feedback** - result of creativity,
- **Social** Pressure -  
- **Unpredictability** and **curiosity** - not sure what will happen next
- **Loss Avoidance** - to avoid a loss

reward loop - loot, drop systems


# Social

## Cultural

### Mimetic theory
-Desires are cultural not individual. We learn imitating group.
- good -
- bad - acquisitive like money

- Scapegoat - find someone to blame for conflict, to unite sides. (controlling violence with violence) can be in mimetic context



### FOMO
### Ikigai
- role in society




## Multiplayer
Guilds/ clans
Cooperation give chance for Positive externalities (benefit for others)

asymmetry dominance  
framing priming  
prospect theory  


rewards can be demotivated:

over justification:  
- les interest dwawing if later no rewards
- les creative more prone to cheat
- les motivated if reward stop

### Others
story creativity

```
- emotional labor
- building TENTION ?
```

(For kids short videos are worse than long because of shortening attention span)



central to game design
- addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation
-  motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.


```
##### Tips  
- show purpose before giving reward Goals must be `meaningful`! for players     '
- after meaningful actions clear goals. Why important
- show value / personalize
- more effort / time needed, greater reward expected     
- absence is like a punishment    
- intermitted intervals for forming habits  
- fixed ration to sense of mastery   
- variable ratio for excitement  
- reward is not an ending but starting point  
- help player feel being in control
- Illusion of control is as good as real contr. Loosing control can be mechanic as well: Stanley Parable.

#### Self Control and inhibitory control
being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed.
