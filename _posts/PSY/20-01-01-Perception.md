# Sensation and Perception


http://consc.net/papers/c-and-c.html

perception is ambiguous bistable



- **Perception** is the interface between external events and sensory receptors.  
- [Cognition](/cognition/) is the transformation of sensory data into concepts.  ((information sorting) and requires at the very least, short term memory.)  
- **Consciousness** is the (conflictual) interaction between the most elaborate concepts, which are the images of oneself and the world.  
ability to simulate other systems within itself.

There are discontinuities in the process of neural organization, but they are in much larger number than these 3 steps. Each discontinuity has relative organizational independence. This is what prevents the mental process from being completely chaotic.

"higher consciousness" is the ability to simulate the cognitive system within itself. In essence a cognitive feedback loop.
 "higher consciousness" allows, is the recognition of our own motivations

Every living thing before self awareness, is a pure product of natural (or man made) motivations stemming from the need to reproduce in order to survive, down to a molecular level, all the way back to single cell organisms.



# Reaction Time

| | average reaction time |
|---|---|
0.25 | visuals (160ms - 340ms) (0.4s for: Go/NoGo reaction for AI)
0.17 | audio
0.15 | touch stimulation is fastest



# Visual Perception

## Human Vision

| | |
|---|---|
15 x 2 | preferred viewing area 30 (left + right)  
25 x 2 | immediate field o f view (max eye movement)  
60 x 2 | head rotation  (console games)  
95 x 2 | head & eyes  (max viewing area)   

## Gestalt Principles


| |Principle |   |
| - | - |- |
<img src="/src/gestalt/gestprinc_v1.0003.png" width="100">  |Emergence | **Complex pictures from simple pattern**
<img src="/src/gestalt/gestprinc_v1.0001.png" width="100"> |Reification |  **Illusory continuity** constructive or generative aspect of perception
<img src="/src/gestalt/gestprinc_v1.0002.png" width="100"> |Multistability | **Figure-Ground**,  pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations     
<img src="/src/gestalt/gestprinc_v1.0004.png" width="100">|Invariance | **Objects recognition** is  independent of rotation, elastic deformations, light, component features


## Gestalt law of pragnanz

Law of Perception (pragnanz. which means â€˜concise and meaningful)

||Law |Tend to be perceived as integrated into groups if ... |  |
| - | - | - |- |
||**Simplicity** | ... is good gestalt  (Simplify for better reads)
||**Proximity** | ... they are near each other. (Natural grouping) | Clump of grass.
||**Common fate**  |... they move together. | Pixels on next movie frames
|| **Similarity** |  ... they are similar to each other
| | **Continuity**|  ... they are aligned with each other (integrated into perceptual wholes)
| | **Closure**|  ... they are parts of a closed figure
|| **Symmetry**| ... symmetry occurs (overwhelm perception). | Linear, radial, mirror. asymetry
| | **Past experience** | ... they were together often in the past experience of the observer |

#### Contrast   
- `Value` high key painting has a `high-value` scale (light) vs `low-value` scale (dark).  
- `Hue/Saturation`  
- `Edge`  
- `Proximity`  
- `Texture` (material), `Shape`

#  Visual Phenomena & Optical Illusions

#### Change blindness
phenomenon of visual perception that occurs when a stimulus undergoes a change without this being noticed by its observer.

#### Perception load
