**Perception** is the interface between external events and sensory receptors.  
[Cognition](/cognition/) is the transformation of sensory data into concepts.  ((information sorting) and requires at the very least, short term memory.)
**Consciousness** is the (conflictual) interaction between the most elaborate concepts, which are the images of oneself and the world.  
ability to simulate other systems within itself.

There are discontinuities in the process of neural organization, but they are in much larger number than these 3 steps. Each discontinuity has relative organizational independence. This is what prevents the mental process from being completely chaotic.

"higher consciousness" is the ability to simulate the cognitive system within itself. In essence a cognitive feedback loop.
 "higher consciousness" allows, is the recognition of our own motivations

Every living thing before self awareness, is a pure product of natural (or man made) motivations stemming from the need to reproduce in order to survive, down to a molecular level, all the way back to single cell organisms.



# Reaction Time

| | average reaction time |
|---|---|
0.25 | visuals
0.17 | audio
0.15 | touch stimulation






# Visual Perception

## Human Vision

| | |
|---|---|
15 x 2 | preferred viewing area 30 (left + right)  
25 x 2 | immediate field o f view (max eye movement)  
60 x 2 | head rotation  (console games)  
95 x 2 | head & eyes  (max viewing area)   

## Gestalt



**Gestalt Principles**

| |Principle |   |
| - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/emergencesmall.png) |Emergence | **Complex pictures from simple pattern**
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) |Reification |  **Illusory continuity** constructive or generative aspect of perception
![](/src/gestalt/multistabilitysmall.png) |Multistability | **Figure-Ground**,  pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations     
![](/src/gestalt/invariancesmall.png) |Invariance | **Objects recognition** is  independent of rotation, elastic deformations, light, component features




**Law of Perception**  
Gestalt law of pragnanz. which means ‘concise and meaningful‘

||Law |Tend to be perceived as integrated into groups if ... |  |
| - | - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)|**Simplicity** | ... is good gestalt  (Simplify for better reads)
![](/src/gestalt/proximsmall.png)|**Proximity** | ... they are near each other. (Natural grouping) | Clump of grass.
![](/src/gestalt/commonsmall.png)|**Common fate**  |... they move together. | Pixels on next movie frames
  ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png) | **Similarity** |  ... they are similar to each other
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Continuity**|  ... they are aligned with each other (integrated into perceptual wholes)
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) | **Closure**|  ... they are parts of a closed figure
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Symmetry**| ... symmetry occurs (overwhelm perception). | Linear, radial, asymetry
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Past experience** | ... they were together often in the past experience of the observer |

# Cognitive Biases

Biases and fallacies are not optimal

 bias can be distinguished: information bias, selection bias, and confounding.


|Behavioral biases (	Decision-making, belief) |Tendency to:|-|
|-|-|-|
|Anchoring | First thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows | First offer sets an ‘anchor’ price which will influence how counter-offer might seem
|Priming |  (what u see before )
|Halo effect | How much you like someone, or how attractive they are, influences your other judgments of them
|Availability Heuristic |  Judgments are influenced by what springs most easily to mind (something happened in same place)
|Availability Cascade | media report > public panic
|In-Group bias | unfairly favor those who belong to your group.
|Sunk Cost | ... thing that have already cost you something.
|
|Framing|
|Group thinking |social dynamics of a group situation override the best outcomes.
|Optimism, Pessimism | overestimate the likelihood of positive / negative outcome
|Placebo|
|
|
|Curse of Knowledge | Presume  that others have same knowledge | Understand something is obvious to everyone get it
|Dunning-Kruger effect|
|Confirmation bias  | Favor things that confirm your existing beliefs.  
|False-Consensus Effect    
|Belief bias | anything that supports actual believes
|Self-serving bias |  failures are due to external factors, yet you're responsible for your successes.
|Backfire effect|
|Barnum effect|
|Negativity bias | negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.
|Diclinism |
|Fundamental Attribution error|
|Just-world hypothesis | preference for justice makes you presume it exists.
|Bystander effect|
|Reactance |  is the tendency to do something different from what someone wants you to do in reaction to a perceived attempt to constrain your freedom of choice.
|Spotlight effect | overestimate how much people notice how you look and act
|Hindsight Bias | (Rationalize that something happened)
|Endowment Effect |(perceive effect) (Want to sell item for more)
|Duration neglect | judgment of painful experiences depend very little on how long those experiences lasted
|Peak-End rule |people judge an experience mostly on how they felt at its peak or very end (shortcut when thinking how feel about exp. you thing about: 1 highest peaks and at end )
|Mere Exposure Effect|
|(More often see more u like it)
| Blind Spot (other feel different than you)
|Regency Bias |  is the phenomenon of a person most easily remembering something that has happened recently,
|Cognitive Ease |  ()
|law of Small numbers |  (next flip have same chance )
|Prospect Theory and Loss Aversion |(insurances , 100% money back, bnrutality in tv) (LOSS > gain)
