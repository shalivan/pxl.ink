# Economy


# Resources

 exchanging resources ( Store or use now bust. )

## Scarcity
- units, currency, objects, time, terrain

#### Health Systems
Pool of points that get subtracted from, eventually it reaches zero, and that initializes a game-over function or increments a death counter ( **life's** ) and restarts a section of gameplay),

How much punished for mistakes

- **regenerating** -  > reward for hiding!!  and not rewarding good play. but get froward momentum.  (it equal chances before next encounter). Cannot hurt player a little as punishment, enemies must be able to kill you
- **health packs**
 - boxes with stuff. if u have health u get ammo. Or coins to spend not always on health
- **glory kill** reward >> offensive system and encourage to play

- mixed:
  - regen last few %
  - regen when other conditions. Only if the second variable influenced by ie food is at a certain point  (Minecraft)

#### Action Points
mana (actions) - spiritual or magical energy / karma / stamina  -   Non renevable / renevable
