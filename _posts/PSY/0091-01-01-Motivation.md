Human behavior is complex. Optimizing social behavior since 1980: sociobiology > evolutionary psychology.

# Attention
### Attention
Selective concentration on a discrete stimulus while ignoring other perceivable stimuli. Affect Cognitive load: (amount of mental effort being used)

`Area of focus` of brain is like thumb of hand in front of u

### Engagement  
Psychological presence. According to his definition, engagement refers to the state in which individuals express their entire self  `Flow` / the `Zone` / `Immerse`: altered time. fully `immersed` with mechanics while challenge and tension in balance  (anxiety vs boredom)

- primal forces
- context dependend
- expose things to promote them
- predictable

### Agency

# Motivation
Shot of dopamine is not needed,
Drive - (ciekawosc?)   



- Implicit & Biologica = `Impulses`, `Power`, `Achievement`, `Affiliation`    
- Explicit & Implicit Motives -
- Intrinsic & Extrinsic - Personal Grtification
- Autonomus - (self determinated) vs. Controled - (non self determinated)


```


# Implicit & Biological
`Impulses`, `Power`, `Achievement`, `Affiliation`

# Individual

Personalities
Personality traits OCEAN
Temperament
Myers-Briggs / 16 Personalities



**Locus of control** is a psychological concept that refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives.

# Behaviorism
Behavioral theories of motivation focus on how the results weâ€™ve obtained from past behaviors shape our future behaviors (Enviromental Shaped & Learned Drives) In this theory internal needs of individuals can be ignored. Reinforcement needs to be more than a one-off event.

- Positive Reinforcement
- Negative Reinforcement.
- Punishment.
- Extinction.

### Continuous Reinforcement
All responces are reinforced
happens when the desired behavior is reinforced each time it is observed. continuous reinforcement is the quickest way to get someone to develop a new behavior.

### Intermittent  Reinforcement
Some responces are reinforced
| |Interval (after time)|Ratio (after action)|
|--|--|--|
__Fixed__  Predictable | kill > loot spawn, stamina (building up high peak and quick drop)  | One more turn. clickers,  turnbased building time (short post reinforcement pause)
__Variable__ Unpredictable |  public events (moderate stady response pattern) | Gambling. Loot drops, Crit hits  (high stady responce pattern, small bumps)


### Contingent
- `Not-Contingent` - not related to behavior (suprice gifts), not controled
- `Task-Contingent` - rewarding: `engagement`, `completion`, `perdormance`. Sense of progression - task releated motivate more contingent outcomes are not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.




### Feadback
feadback on action is reward  !!!
reward timeing and (un)certanity - immediate for success progress and choice
delayed feedback need stronger support
nitr geting rew u expect could become punishmenbnt   

`Representative Heuristic` - Time/Cost/Effort > Up expectation for reward . (Procedural like rouglikes play agianst it sometimes)  balanced economy   




- reward can be demotivating
- Unexpexted reward are motivating
- Expectations. After bad luck we expect payout (gambling).
- Representative expectations - (Ngram colors in destiny)
- Loss Aversion: Smt I have > Sth I coul

# Self Determination Teroy
### SDT
 Depend on contecst and not account for all human behavior. Can shift by different frameing. OLD: `Intrinsic` -  Personal Grtification. last longer. rate higher! better (autonomy, angency, progression, feedback, oportunity). But cann feel bad i.e. if you are obligated to your self vs. `Extrinsic` - External. Rewards shape to do but risk of shifting motivation. Use when needed (money) But! can feel autonomus if enbough choices

`Autonomus` - (self determinated) vs. `Controled` - (non self determinated) Illusion of controll is as good as real contr.


| SDT | |
|--|--|
Competence  |sense of progression, sense of being in control Interact with activities. everyone want be bst
Autonomy | self expression or meaningfull:  choice (not satidfy by chose)
Relatedness |  cooperation or competition. Rank relation. (knowledge where i fit)

### PENS
Player Experience of Needed Satisfaction


| PENS | ||
|--|--|--|
Competence  | Easy to learn dificult to master  | skill: survival, crafting
Autonomy | choice, customization, agency | your world, your creations
Relatedness |  social grouping, status feadback  | shared experiences, public canvases

```
##### Tips  
- show purpose before giving reward Goals must be `meaningfull`! for players     '
- after miningfull avctions clear goals. Why important
- show value / personalize
- more effort / time needed, greater reward expected     
- absence is like a punishment    
- intermited intervals for forming habits  
- fixed ration to sense of mastery   
- variable ratio for excitement  
- reward is not an ending but starting point  
- help player feel beeing in control
- Illusion of controll is as good as real contr. Loosing control can be mechanic as well: stanley parable.

# Gamer motivation profile

|Gamer motivation profile|High|Low|
|--|--|--|
`Comunity`|Teamwork - comunity driven sacrafice control   | Independence
`Competition`  | High conflict, duels social comparison | Non-adversarial - no ranks Cooperation
`Excitement` | Fast Paced, surprises |
`Destruction`| Chaos | No weapons, no explosions
`Completion` | Task oriented (Get all colectables) | Sandbox (most age stable motivation)   
`Power`| Level up, grind character / equipment    | Static level and flat progres
`Strategy` | Thinking ahead  |    
`Challenge`  | Practice, high difficulty skill based | Easy fun  
`Fantasy` | Being someone else  |    
`Story` | Scripted drama, character | Open Ended Plot
`Discovery` |Hiden curious explore   | Full exposed minimal unknow
`Design` | Customisation | Expression  

Motivation GDC:  

Novelity - Fantasy/realism.  Build/explore  
Challenge - Skilled/No  Work/not work  
Harmony -  mechanics/context   cooperation/conflikt  
Stimulation - singiel/multi   calm/thrill   

---

#  Emotion
>Emotions are motivations by `Discovery, novelity, suprises`

`Game Feel` - is it seem real, does mehanics alow us to do sth. feeling of competence and growth mastery   
`Interaction` - is positive


People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

### Multiplayer
Guilds/ clans
Cooperation give chance for Positive externalities (benefit for others)

##### Toxicity
- Anonimity
- Significant time involved
- Latch opportunities by teammates mistakes
- Dunninf-Kruger Effect





###  Flow  
`Game Folow` - is wave zone between anexity and boredom (sometimes challenge and sometimes powerfull)  
- `Dificulty Curve` - Challange  
- `Paceing` Rythm + Pressure >Manage stress. If there is no stress its not meaningfull and you dont care. So pressure is good  
- `Learning Curve` - Onboarding > tutorials super important

# Choice
paradox of choice - we can be hap[ier witlh less choices

- more information player have more miningful is choice
- changeing decision need effort thou is more dificult with time pass
- intended `influences` (disneyland/vegas) / not intended `options` (autonomy)
- make secondary order decisions.

##### availability heuristic  (of memory)
- more we know (familiarity breeds liking)
- vivid choice (sth is present is more likley)
- cost with make decision its why we dont change our minds  (+ sank effort in already choscen path)
- like is unconcious is therefor likley that is what you want

##### prionciples of how we choose:
>less about choice more to conform mind in feeling we are in controll. we are always in way from A to B. so its ok to be linear
- choices is not:
agency - capacity to chose
autonomy - capacity to make decisions  (multiplayer huge autonomy)

# Satisfaction
1) challange   
- chelenging task
- flow state > zom  
release neurotransmiters : `dopamin` `serotonin` `endorphines`
x

McGurk effect - takje video of important context of hearing audio
book: `satisfaction`  Gregory Berns

2) feadback  
sounds satisfaing because of feadback. even small delay can  estroy effect


3) recognize  
if we know the meaning and can recogniz e interpret or understand

brain have idea and it must fit to reality. To meet expectations is important  
Illusion of control is just as much impact as real

rewards can be demotivated:

overjustification:  
- les interes dwawing if later no rewards
- les creaticve more prone to cheat
- les motivated if reward stop
