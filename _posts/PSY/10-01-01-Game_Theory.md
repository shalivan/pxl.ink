# Game Theory
mathematical study of optimizing agents strategies in games where outcome depend on other agents actions. (payoff is affected by the decisions mede by others)




**two player vs more**





## Cooperative
**How to be fair.**
- coalition and benefit and contribution type in coalition
**Shapley Value** - method of dividing gains  or costs  among players acording to value of individual contribution

**Marginal Contribution** -  is determined by ehat is gain or lost  by removing them from the game

if 2 parties bring same things to coalition, they should have to contribute  the same amount &  should  be revarded  for their contributions equal.

Dummy player have 0 value

## Competitive
**How to be smart.**

**Nash equilibrium**
(decide to be better off no matter what opponent will do)
(rational play when more then one player. not only define start but always believes)
Is a concept within game theory where the optimal outcome of a game is where no player have incentives to deviate from initial strategy.

**Poisoner dilemma**
Very complicated not always everything plays around these lines. (some Exceptions)   
multiple goals, number of rounds....  In lot of species there is no cognitive strategy  


## Zero Sum Game
 Interest is not overlapping. `win-lose`


## Imperfect information games
- depth limited search.



# Strategies

MinMax - minmimize maximum lose. ensure you guarded by worst scenario. (use in zero sum)


**Tic Tac Toe**  

##### Pavlov strategy
 - switch if not working (you can exploit)

#### TfT
-  `Tit for tat` drove other strategies to extinction and formalize optimal strategy  may lose battles but win wars. (Vulnerable of signal error). Start nice cooperating > forgiving > cooperate when you can   

#### FTfT
- `forgiving tit for tat`  witch is more vulnerable for exploitation TfT -> jezeli zaufanie to switch to forgiven TFTF Trust  

#### Madness
- possibility of changes   
Strategies to survive forgiving tic for tat (vulnerable to exploit) > forgiven tic for tat after while  
- counterintuitive moves could help with strength opponents.


#### Game Theory Optimal
- assumes opponent is always countering with the perfect strategy
- can have lower yield EV then exploitative play

pkr > fint highest EV lines routes possible for have best formulatetd strategy. + balance it to dont be exploited.
but can be not profitable as exploit.  
balance stratedy  

##### Exploitative
-humans make a lot errors  exploit mistakes


## Tradegy of the Commons
Some public good lot of persons contribute noone want to pay cause take a small parts of contribution only.( there is mat trouh to compensate )
