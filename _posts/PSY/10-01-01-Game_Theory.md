- Very complicated not always everything plays around these lines. (some Exceptions)   
- In lot of species there is no cognitive strategy  
- To work every agent must play with GT rules. But its rational to behave time to ttime irrational
-  multiple goals

# Game Theory
mathematical study of optimizing agents strategies in games where outcome depend on other agents actions. (payoff is affected by the decisions mede by others)


### Two vs. More players


### Turn based vs. Simultaneous move    

### Number of Rounds
- infinite
- repeated

### Perfect vs. Imperfect information games
vs. known informations
- depth limited search.


### Zero Sum Game
 - Interest is not overlapping. `win-lose`







# Cooperative
How to be fair  
Group best effort, coalition and benefit and contribution type in coalition

### Shapley Value
- method of dividing gains  or costs  among players according to value of individual contribution

### Marginal Contribution
-  is determined by ehat is gain or lost  by removing them from the game

if 2 parties bring same things to coalition, they should have to contribute  the same amount &  should  be revarded  for their contributions equal.

Dummy player have 0 value

### Pareto efficiency
Outcom is Pareto optimal if there is no outcome that makes at least one player better off without making any player worse off.


# Competitive
How to be smart  
Actor best interest - sub optimal solution in the long run


### Nash equilibrium
optimal outcome of a game is where no player have incentives to deviate from initial strategy.  
(decide to be better off no matter what opponent will do) (rational play when more then one player. not only define start but always believes) Every player play `best response`  strategy  to what other doing. Knowing other strategies and have no insentives to cheat. Everyone want to keepe it without policing

Most games have odd number of wquilibria

no player have profitable deviations



# Terms

### Risk Aversion
how much u willing to pay for insurance



### Tragedy of the Commons
Some public good lot of persons contribute noone want to pay cause take a small parts of contribution only.( there is mat trouh to compensate )   


there are certain optimal strategies and no other GT solution





# Strategies


#### MinMax  
- minmimize maximum lose. ensure you guarded by worst scenario. (use in zero sum)

#### Mix Strategy
- play only if there are indiferences in few strategies


#### Forward Induction



#### Backward Induction
- Whenever I'm making move now I should focus on what opponent will do after that. maximizing - not always good


#### Tic Tac Toe


#### Pavlov strategy
 - switch if not working (you can exploit)

#### TfT
-  `Tit for tat` drove other strategies to extinction and formalize optimal strategy  may lose battles but win wars. (Vulnerable of signal error). Start nice cooperating > forgiving > cooperate when you can   

#### FTfT
- `forgiving tit for tat`  witch is more vulnerable for exploitation TfT -> jezeli zaufanie to switch to forgiven TFTF Trust  

#### Madness
- possibility of changes   
Strategies to survive forgiving tic for tat (vulnerable to exploit) > forgiven tic for tat after while  
- counterintuitive moves could help with strength opponents.


#### Game Theory Optimal
- assumes opponent is always countering with the perfect strategy
- can have lower yield EV then exploitative play

pkr > fint highest EV lines routes possible for have best formulatetd strategy. + balance it to dont be exploited.
but can be not profitable as exploit.  
balance stratedy  

##### Exploitative
-humans make a lot errors  exploit mistakes


# Bargaining
Bargening dynamics get really complicated really quickly.


| ||
| ---| ---|
| Proposal power |  make offers to the other side (accept/reject position not good)
| Patience  | no needing a deal (**Tragedy of bargening**) 'rich get richer'
| Outside options |
| Monopoly | Unique quality
| Knowledge | knowledge of the others sides minimum value dont know choose between lesser of two evils
| Reputation|
| Credible commitment | contracts good / black market bad
| Costly signals of higher value |

**Ultimatum** Game Assumptions - single ultimatum, Take or leave it

# Games





#### Poisoner Dilemma
number show years in jail if Cooperate or Defect

||Cooperate|Defect |
|--|--|--|
**Cooperate**|-1, -1 |0 , -10
**Defect** | -10, 0 | 5, 5

Defect strategy dominate cooperate
Better of Defecting regardless what other player does  

#### Stag Hunt

neither player deviate

||Stag|Rabbit|
|--|--|--|
**Stag**|3, 3 |  0 , 2
**Rabbit** | 2, 0 | 1, 1

Stag/Stag (pareto efficient) and Rabit/Rabit (pareto inefficient) are equilibrias.

- if no lies

#### Matching Pennies
Zero sum game.  No pure strategy nash equilibrium.  
If no pure nash exist in mix strategies.  



||Heads|Tails|
|--|--|--|
**Heads**|1, -1 |  -1 , 1
**Tails** | -1, 1 | 1, -1

Coin filps


#### Batle of sexes


||Heads|Tails|
|--|--|--|
**Heads**|1, 2 | 0 , 0
**Tails** | 0, 0 | 2, 1

(1,2) - are nash



# Poker

## Basics

|||
|-|-|
Button|
Small Blind |
Big Blind | play garbage hands (range advantage)
Under The Gun | the player to the left of the big blind. the player has to act first.

## Why Anties
to force action

## Bounty

## GTO
Game theory optimal - is not enough agressive.



U MUST EXPLOIT OPPONENTS AND LOOK WEAKNES IN THEM
kombninatoryka wazna

Optimize decisions and  
build strategies to put opponents in place where they have hard time with optimization their decisions.
