- every question brought by the plot is an promise , keep best to keep those promises
- rules for world for all characters same
- black and white reality is simple but .... ??

### Story  & Plot
A story is a series of events recorded in their chronological order. A plot is a series of events deliberately arranged so as to reveal their dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance.

Cannot say a story without `Place`, `Time` and `Character`. Or you can :> ?

   - `Premise` -  Meaningful, obietnica, zapowiedz
   - `Causality` -  Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)
   - `Character` reveale when human characters make choices under pressure
   -  Establish conflict, Twist
   - `Pacing`, `Build up` Stimulus delta over moments. Surprise changes moment to moment and our desire.




`Beginning` - to engage  
`Peak` -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)
`End` - brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory  


plot along motivation  
novel, unique, cohesive, meaningful  
Structure in games is not as important  

(theme and moral)
