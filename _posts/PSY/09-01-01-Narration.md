Narrative Experience


# Medium
Stories define how we consume information,  create emotional experience, expand our view of the world. Telling stories is in human nature.  (to not feel alone in universe?)    

Every medium have it own narrations styles, varying on genres and format (series, shorts...). Linear narrative is not enough for games. See or listen not as powerful as play themselves.
Structure in games is not as important.


Stories emerge from our consciousness and observing ourselves and understand what is what we are doing.
Successful life when you family, survive and thrive

Games and stories share a lot in common

# Storytelling Paradigm

## Premise
**Premise is single core statement**, the foundation of story. premise statement is often a familiar expression or cliché. 'Latin words, meaning to put before'   
**Thematic idea** - drives its structure and delivery   


##  Story
**Story  tells who and what** - (Circumstances) - Series of events recorded in their chronological order,  sequence of events. Story includes all of the events described that make up a narrative.  What is the topic, what are the issue. Story is more than one idea.


  - Unique story or have a twist or something to say.    
  - To what extent do circumstances affect the nature of actions?

##  Plot
**Plot tells how** - (Action) -  With story in mind, you can decide how to plot it. Series of events deliberately arranged so as to reveal their dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance, and create tension.

- **Umbrella plot**  we will do x because core plot of genre

### Character vs plot driven story
Without internal conflict plot have no meaning - why it matters  


**Character driven story** - inner transformation and relations with other why something matters to character giving his desires and fears  Move story through action and choices. Character as agent of change.  
**Plot is external conflict**  - what's happened. Events of the story move story forward and cause character to react    




## Narration
**Narrative tells why** - (Description) - Interpretation of the events within the story. point of view of the story. Gameplay, dialog, notes, setting, graphics

Linear, non linear

### Point of view

||Past|	Present|	Future|
|---|---|---|---|
First|	autobiographies|	wills|		shopping lists
Second	|letters|	adventure books	|ransom notes
Third|	novels|	plays (theater)	|instructions

#### First-person narrator

I / Me / My - Character is telling the story. connection, access to thoughts. share emotions, strong characterization but: restricted to one character, difficult .filter words to show perspective of character  

– występuje w gatunkach epickich.

Może on być jednym z uczestników opowiadanych wydarzeń, ich świadkiem, kronikarzem lub osobą rekonstruującą minione wypadki. Jego wiedza jest ograniczona – wie jedynie to, czego sam doświadczył, albo co przekazali mu inni.

Opowieść narratora pierwszoosobowego może przyjmować m.in. takie formy jak ustna relacja, autobiografia, pamiętnik, dziennik, listy czy monolog wewnętrzny.

#### Third-person narrator  
She / He Her / His - External narrator is telling the story.    Commentator / Interviewer

||||
|---|---|---|
|Ontological status | **Homodiegetic** (within world, part of story) interviewer | **Heterodiegetic** (outside (commentary / HUD)) detached observer
| Shapedness of narrator | **Personal** (we know a characteristic of narrator and can picture narrator) | **Non-personal** (Only story is narrated)
|Knowledge | **Restricted** | **All-Knowing** - Omnipotent / Omniscient
| Nature of narrator's utterance act with regards to story world facts | **Representing** (represents already exiting story and world) | **Stipulating**  (stipulates story through narrating)


# Storytelling in games


## Explicit Narration
Cutscenes text written narrator    





In literature: An explicit narrator is a narrator or character in a story that is the one telling the story. First person narrators are by definition explicit narrators.


##  Implied Narration
Implicit

An implied narrative arises from visual cues that create the barest impression of a story in the minds of viewers. It is the act of withholding the whole story, rather than the attempt to visually illustrate the story, that defines these images

player must figure out itself   
implicit refers to something that is suggested or implied but not ever clearly said.

a reliable character telling their own story, a character telling another character's story, and an unreliable character telling the story.

Mistrust and misdirection  oftren are good narative tools    

##  Emergent Narration
Emerge from system     
Mechanics in narration - implement plot in mechanics  

###  Narrative vs Mechanics Driven
How much power over the world

**Game story domination**  -   
**Player story domination** -   


mechanick video storytell:
- Edit finth, fish gameplay
- Half Life2, can to trash tutorial


### Ludo narrative Harmony
- Action fit settings to achieve harmony relation between narration and gameplay
premise and setting of story make sense with actions you perform
- It only appear when player can interact with world in meaningful for a story way. feel game through the gameplay
how themes are communicated through the gameplay

[Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)  





### Procedural storytelling

##  Environmental Narration


## Experience
Experience as an end itself


### Paradox of control
key element of enjoyment
how to offer meaningful choice  without offering full control.

# Structure

Cannot say a story without **Place**, **Time** and **Character**. Or you can

- plot relevancy - only add essentials that matter. to much - boring, to little - implausible
- every question brought by the plot is an promise , keep best to keep those promises
- every step in journey should bring you little bit to final
- sense of progress from ballet point to bullet point > sections.
- moment goal reach story is over
- Promise > Progress > Payoff
- Substitution plot :L give sth else than what expected /harder to write/

##### Introduction / Beginning
- to engage
- roznicza miedzy pokazywaniem tajemnicy / wprowadzaniem motywów a randomem
- cold open (start in adventure)
- play with expectation,  

##### Peak / Twist
- (tentpole - most expensive mom)  

##### End / Payoff
- payoff should give u everything from premise of beginning
character how will change    
- brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory    


## Three-Act structure
**Setup** >  
**Conflict** >  
**Resolution**  >  
with plot points are between phases  

## MICE
A way to categorize stories, but also a loose guideline on where to start and end a story based on how it’s categorized  

When do multiple stories: nest one inside other.   
**Milieu** (Setting)- enter new places > navigate, struggle to exit survive > return or exit (Gulliver, Alice in Wonderland, The Hobbit)    
**Inquiry** (Idea) -  Ask question > dead end answer > process of finding information or question (murder mysteries, The Da Vinci Code.)    
**Character** - Internal Thread  that identity shift. Unhappy about self > Tries to change ways, attempt to break out >  Change  
**Event** - Action. Sth disturb status quo.> chases, fight > Status q External thread  




## Narrative Arc
Narrative arc make  viewer curious how story will end

**Exposition** - settings and places   opening  during the story object can inherit meaning and emotional value    
**Rising Action** - move plot forward, establish conflict     
**Climax** - tensest moment of crisis  , confrontation  
**Falling Action** - move toward ending   denouement  
**Resolution**  - back to stability  



## Games structure

Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.


#### Cycles

**Second to second**     
**Minute to minute**     
**Hour to Hour**  

- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change


#### Endgame

.



Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.

# Structure Elements



- Coincidence are bad in story
- Show a little details that can paint a grander picture.
- **Strange attractor** new spin on familiar idea or 2 ideas
- **Seeding** Spreading tiny bits of exposition
- **Payoff** Response   
- **Foreshadowing** Plant idea ahead and earlier to connect later  

## Scope
To much stories in witch the fate of the world was at stake
Bigger stakes not equal more powerful stories


## Exposition

- Explanation is not as fun as phenomena itself.

### Exposition Scene in cinema

- Create a desire to know by arousing curiosity. With hunger for information even most complicated set of dramatized facts will pass smoothly into understanding.
- Dave the best for last
- Deliver surprises based on established rules
[Story by: Robert McKee]

Dialog or action - which move plot forward
Scenes  włozone dla wyjasnienie jak jest plot hole
exposition by narration  ??

### Show and Tell in writing

**Showing** dramatizes - emotions opinions sensations. deeper and details to feel more connecting to experience      
**Telling** summarize -  “Talk is cheap.” Actions speak louder than words    
[Craft of Fiction by: Perry Tubbock]

As long as it character think its ok, if it sounds like author butting into explain things you've probably fallen into telling [Understanding Show, Don't Tell by: Janice Hardy]     


Stronger showing:
- Don't show monster but causes it makes u scared
- Avoid opinion related adjectives like:  beautiful
- use evidence for claims and let them go to conclusion You want to make. 2+2
- emotions are complex concept and must be demonstrated with concrete details.  showing with details

# Dramatic Elements


|||
|--|--|
Focus |  energies into achieving the given goals or objectives of a character in a scene
Tension | development of tension usually parallels the advancement of the plot, leading to a crisis or climax. Tension is closely linked with timing
Timing |  to create contrast in a scene or simply to demonstrate robotic, stylised and non-naturalistic movements. Rhythm and pace are affected
Rhythm | timing and pace of the drama. It also means the beat or tempo h. Rhythm can follow the emotional state
Contrast  | Without the careful use of contrast a performance is boring and lacks tension. A manipulating the drama to create a change in setting, use of space or rhythm. The pace of scenes can also be altered, as can various dramatic elements within one small section of a performance
Mood & Atmosphere|  ambience or aura  
Space | such as sitting, bending over, lying down or crawling. Of course, using the space around
Language |
Sound |  
Symbol | greater meaning than the literal suggestion. ie Color

Dramatic moments happening  on screen (cutscenes) are less dramatic because you just look without a control

Theory developed by Christopher Booker

|||
|--|--|
Overcoming the Monster | Sets out to defeat an antagonistic force (often evil) which threatens the protagonist and/or protagonist's homeland.   
Rebirth | An event forces the main character to change their ways and often become a better individual.
The Quest | Acquire an important object or to get to a location. They face temptations and other obstacles along the way.  
Voyage and Return | Goes to a strange land and, after overcoming the threats it poses or learning important lessons unique to that location, they return with experience.   
Rags to Riches | Poor protagonist acquires power, wealth, and/or a mate, loses it all and gains it back, growing as a person as a result
Tragedy | Fall of fundamentally good character
Comedy | Dramatic work in which the central motif is the triumph over adverse circumstance, resulting in a successful or happy conclusion.  conflict becomes more and more confusing, but is at last made plain in a single clarifying event.
