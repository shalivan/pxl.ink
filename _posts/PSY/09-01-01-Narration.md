# Medium
- Every medium have it own narration style. Linear narrative is not enough for games.  
- See or listen not as powerful as play themselves

Telling stories is in human nature.


- **Story**  tells who and what.   
  - Series of events recorded in their chronological order,  sequence of events.
  - Story includes all of the events described that make up a narrative.
- **Plot** tells how.   
  - With story in mind, you can decide how to plot it.
  - Series of events deliberately arranged so as to reveal their dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance, and create tension.  
- **Narrative** tells why.   
  - Interpretation of the events within the story. point of view of the story.



## Key Concept
What is the topic, what are the issue.  
Unique story or have a twist or sth to say.   
- Give 2+2
- Book is more than one idea.

# Ludonarrative Harmony

## Structure
### Place, Time, Character
Cannot say a story without **Place**, **Time** and **Character**. Or you can :> ?
- **Premise** -  Meaningful, Promise, announce
- **Causality** -  Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)
- **Character** revile when human characters make choices under pressure
-  **Establish conflict**, **Twist**
- **Pacing**, **Build up** Stimulus delta over moments. Surprise changes moment to moment and our desire.

Memorable moments:
- **Beginning** - to engage   
- **Peak** -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)  
- **End** - brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory    

### 3 acts
Greek  
Setup > conflict > resolution
plot points are between phases
(opening > crises > up tension > climax > denouement  )



##### Tension
crisis and climax
dyolemat niejednoznaczne rozwiazanie
balance between: anxiet  and boredom

### Monomyth
  Heroes Journey: **You**, **Need**, **Go**, **Search**, **Find**, **Take**, **Return**, **Change**  (Joseph Campbell)
  - What with serials and games ? Its less relevant.


### Meta
Grand narrative
Claim to apply to all people (common to everyone.)
Universal, Natural, Structural,
(what really behind story.)
postmodernism: world is more complicated. Any large claim to be a thrue for all people is outdated  (short termism) not about future

Lyotard (postmodern coditoin book)

[our chices and outtside forces are prepearing and shaping what come next  ]
wy we are here what abnout future what are consequences, story about being free
not how human is but how should bne like
[] nature is not only good it kills u too. and culture saves u

Post modernism - skepticism tough meta narrative
no such think as through knowledge all we have is subjecvtiver opinion

### 4-Layers in games
  1. what am I doing and how
  2. narrative goal (short term) gratifications
  3. Narrative background. How my knowledge increase
  4. Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.

https://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2014/04/4-layers-narrative-design-approach.html

### Scope
To much stories in witch the fate of the world was at stake
Bigeger stakes not equal more powerfull stories


## Exposition

Coincidence are bad in stroy

### Show it dont tell it
show vs tell - showing dramatizes / telling summarize

“Talk is cheap.” “Actions speak louder than words

Show not tell
showing dramatize
tell summarize

as long as it character thing its ok,
stronger showing
- use evidence for claims
- emotions are complex concept and must be shoiwn with details



###  Seeding
spreading tiny bits of
exposition

### payoff
RESPONCE -


### Foreshadowing
Plant idea ahead and earlier to connect later

# Mechanics in narration
Earier established gandra
Try to implement plot in mechanics
mechanick video storytell:
- odcinnie ryb
- nawyki (zajbijasz normalnie w grach a tu moze byc pod zapytaniem ładna muza jak nie zabijasz > enforce in gameplay )
morrals
attach to charcter

---



```

- sense of progress from bbullet point to bullet point > sections. and organize them in plot

- change from inactive tro proactive  
- try fail cycle

- dont show monseter but causes it make
- roznicza miedzy pokazywaniem tajemnicy / wprowadzaniem motywów a randomem

- promies > progress > payoff

Mistrust and misdirection  oftren are good narative tools

twist


known   
known unknown   
unknown unknow  


contrast: elemental oposites. dobro zło ogien lod


- cold open (start in adventure)
- when cleache is well executed is not a cliche (clishe is when its not driving us to the point )
- premiss proper premies and way to get there
- obsticle, desire
- pase
- overpowered to much , no tention
- slight differences
- every step in journey should bring you little bit to final

- fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
- umbrela plot : we will do x because core plot of genre
- arc (character how will change ) suptle inversion to promies
- strange attractor (new spin on familiar idea / 2 ideas )
- plot expansion: instead of twist (u get more than promisied not unexpected change)
- substitution plot :L give sth elese than what expected (harder to write, )
- payof should give u everything from premies of begininig +
- FIRST DRAFT IS OUTLINE

przyklady
- grb team , make plan , on piece miss, ll go great (oceans)
- grab team, explain problems, go throu, you have other problem at end (italian job)
puzzle
- murder mistery: whn to know what hppened and see if detective is wizer than us
- romances: wish fulfilmetns

```


good

- start wit your emotions.
- a big unexpected question
- make story on various level of magnification   
- way it happen must be different than last time
- plot along motivation  
- novel, unique, cohesive, meaningful  
- Structure in games is not as important  
- (theme and moral)
- Invite Questions!!!
- plot relevancy - only add essentials that matter. to much - boring, to little - implausible
- every question brought by the plot is an promise , keep best to keep those promises
- rules for world for all characters same
- black and white reality is simple but .... ??

bad
- exposition - show story
- character asking question
