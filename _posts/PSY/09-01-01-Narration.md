# Medium
- Every medium have it own narration style. Linear narrative is not enough for games.  
- See or listen not as powerful as play themselves


## Literary genre


### Poetry
(liryka) (podmiot liryczny)

### Drama
(bohater)
Na scenie  
comedy, tragedy, dramat

### Fiction/nonfiction
(epika) (narrator)

 nowela, opowiadanie, powieść, bajka epigramatyczna, bajka narracyjna, epopeja (epos), przypowieść.


**Przypowieść** (inaczej parabola)    w którym przedstawione postacie i zdarzenia nie są ważne ze względu na swe cechy jednostkowe, lecz mają wagę jako przykłady uniwersalnych prawideł ludzkiej egzystencji, postaw wobec życia i kolei losu. Świat przedstawiony przypowieści to zbiór sytuacyjnych wykładników jakiejś ogólnej prawdy moralnej, Mimo że przypowieść często ma rozwiniętą fabułę, to zawsze pozostaje ona z racji swego przykładowego charakteru silnie uschematyzowana i uboga w realia, które podlegają tu rygorystycznej selekcji ze względu na nadrzędny sens utworu. Właściwa interpretacja przypowieści wymaga przejścia od jej znaczenia literalnego do ukrytego znaczenia alegorycznego (alegoria) lub moralnego.

**exemplum** (przykład) - odwołuje się do świata znanego swoim odbiorcom,  

**Mystery** - Fiction story that revolves around discovering secrets or solving crimes

**Folktale** - belie with exaggerated chracters and obstacles that is passed down over  
- Myth  - sacred and explain how things cam eto be
- Tall Tale - humorous
- Fairy Tail  - happy end with magic
- Fable - teach morals with animals as char.
- Legend - based on real person but cannot be proven


#### Gatunki pograniczne
 to gatunki z pogranicza literatury, nauki i publicystyki, np. esej, felieton, reportaż. Bio

# Ludonarrative Harmony



## Place, Time, Character
Cannot say a story without **Place**, **Time** and **Character**. Or you can :> ?
- **Premise** -  Meaningful, Promise, announce
- **Causality** -  Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)
- **Character** revile when human characters make choices under pressure
-  **Establish conflict**, **Twist**
- **Pacing**, **Build up** Stimulus delta over moments. Surprise changes moment to moment and our desire.

Memorable moments:
- **Beginning** - to engage   
- **Peak** -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)  
- **End** - brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory

# Structure

###### Story Shape
Ups and downs

###### Tension
crisis and climax
dyolemat niejednoznaczne rozwiazanie
balance between: anxiet  and boredom



###### Scope
To much stories in witch the fate of the world was at stake
Bigeger stakes not equal more powerfull stories



## Meta
Meta-plot Grand narrative
Claim to apply to all people (common to everyone.)
Universal, Natural, Structural,
(what really behind story.)
postmodernism: world is more complicated. Any large claim to be a thrue for all people is outdated  (short termism) not about future

Lyotard (postmodern coditoin book)

[our chices and outtside forces are prepearing and shaping what come next  ]
wy we are here what abnout future what are consequences, story about being free
not how human is but how should bne like
[] nature is not only good it kills u too. and culture saves u

Post modernism - skepticism tough meta narrative
no such think as through knowledge all we have is subjecvtiver opinion

#### Archetypal Events
Birth, Death, Separation from parents, Initiation, Marriage, Union of opposites


## Three-act structure
Greek  
Setup > conflict > resolution  
plot points are between phases  
(opening > crises > up tension > climax > denouement)  



## Monomyth
  Heroes Journey: **You**, **Need**, **Go**, **Search**, **Find**, **Take**, **Return**, **Change**  (Joseph Campbell)
  - What with serials and games ? Its less relevant.


## Game Layers
4-Layers in games
  1. what am I doing and how
  2. narrative goal (short term) gratifications
  3. Narrative background. How my knowledge increase
  4. Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.

# Exposition
Coincidence are bad in story


**Seeding**   
Spreading tiny bits of exposition

**Payoff**   
Response   

**Foreshadowing**   
Plant idea ahead and earlier to connect later  


### Show vs Tell
Showing dramatizes / telling summarize


###### Stronger showing
Show it don't tell it “Talk is cheap.” Actions speak louder than words

- use evidence for claims
- emotions are complex concept and must be shoiwn with details

(as long as it character think its ok)

Rebirth | An event forces the main character to change their ways and often become a better individual.
The Quest | Acquire an important object or to get to a location. They face temptations and other obstacles along the way.  
Voyage and Return | Goes to a strange land and, after overcoming the threats it poses or learning important lessons unique to that location, they return with experience.   
Rags to Riches | Poor protagonist acquires power, wealth, and/or a mate, loses it all and gains it back, growing as a person as a result
Tragedy | Fall of fundamentally good character
Comedy | Dramatic work in which the central motif is the triumph over adverse circumstance, resulting in a successful or happy conclusion.  conflict becomes more and more confusing, but is at last made plain in a single clarifying event.
