Telling stories is in human nature.  
Stories define how we consume information.    

to create emotional experience   
Expand our view of the world   


# Medium
Every medium have it own narration styles, variny on genres and format (series, shorts...). Linear narrative is not enough for games. See or listen not as powerful as play themselves. And structure in games is not as important.


## Literary

#### Genres:
**Poetry** (liryka) (podmiot liryczny)  
**Drama** (bohater) Na scenie  comedy, tragedy, dramat  
**Fiction / Nonfiction** (epika) (narrator)  nowela, opowiadanie, powieść, bajka epigramatyczna, bajka narracyjna, epopeja (epos), przypowieść.  

-  **Parable** (przypowieść)  w którym przedstawione postacie i zdarzenia nie są ważne ze względu na swe cechy jednostkowe, lecz mają wagę jako przykłady uniwersalnych prawideł ludzkiej egzystencji, postaw wobec życia i kolei losu. Świat przedstawiony przypowieści to zbiór sytuacyjnych wykładników jakiejś ogólnej prawdy moralnej, Mimo że przypowieść często ma rozwiniętą fabułę, to zawsze pozostaje ona z racji swego przykładowego charakteru silnie uschematyzowana i uboga w realia, które podlegają tu rygorystycznej selekcji ze względu na nadrzędny sens utworu. Właściwa interpretacja przypowieści wymaga przejścia od jej znaczenia literalnego do ukrytego znaczenia alegorycznego (alegoria) lub moralnego.
-  **Exemplum** (Stories are examples ) odwołuje się do świata znanego swoim odbiorcom    
-  **Folktale** - belie with exaggerated characters and obstacles that is passed down over  
  - Myth  - sacred and explain how things cam eto be
  - Tall Tale - humorous
  - Fairy Tail  - happy end with magic
  - Fable - teach morals with animals as char.
  - Legend - based on real person but cannot be proven
-  **Science and journalism** (Gatunki pograniczne) to gatunki z pogranicza literatury, nauki i publicystyki, np. esej, felieton, reportaż. Bio



## Games
#### Narrative vs mechanics driven:  

**Game story domination**  -   
**Player story domination** -     



How much power over the world

# Idea
Game is more than one idea.

**Elevator pitch**
- Unique story or have a twist or something to say.    



#  Story
**Story  tells who and what**  
  - Series of events recorded in their chronological order,  sequence of events.
  - Story includes all of the events described that make up a narrative.
  - What is the topic, what are the issue.



#  Plot
**Plot tells how**  
  - With story in mind, you can decide how to plot it.

# Meta
**Grand narrative**   - what really behind story.  

## Meaning
Semiotics symbolism and archetypes. of sign process, which is any form of activity, conduct, or any process that involves signs, including the production of meaning.

Skepticism tough meta narrative - Post modernism (large claim to be a true for all people is outdated) (no such think as through knowledge all we have is subjecvtiver opinion) [Lyotard (postmodern coditoin book)]

#### Archetypal Events

# Narration
**Narrative tells why**   
  - Interpretation of the events within the story. point of view of the story.

**Explicit** - cutscenes text written    
**Implicit** - player must figure out itself    
**Emergent** -    
**Environmental narration** -    

### Point of view

- **1st** -  I / Me / My - Character is telling the story. connection, access to thoughts. share emotions, strong characterization but: restricted to one character, difficult .filter words to show perspective of character

|Shapedness | personal | non-personal
|Knowledge | restricted | omnipotent
|Story world facts | representing (represents exiting world) | stipulating  (stipulates story through narration)





---

# Structure

Cannot say a story without **Place**, **Time** and **Character**. Or you can

- plot relevancy - only add essentials that matter. to much - boring, to little - implausible
- every question brought by the plot is an promise , keep best to keep those promises
- every step in journey should bring you little bit to final
- sense of progress from bbullet point to bullet point > sections.
- moment gfoal reach storuy is over


Memorable moments:
- **Beginning** - to engage   
- **Peak** -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)  
- **End** - brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory    



## Three-Act structure
**Setup** > **Conflict** > **Resolution**  
Plot points are between phases  


## Narrative Arc
Narrative arc make  viewer curious how story will end

**Exposition** - settings and places   opening  during the story object can inherit meaning and emotional value    
**Rising Action** - move plot forward, establish conflict     
**Climax** - tensest moment of crisis  , confronataion  
**Falling Action** - move toward ending   denouement  
**Resolution**  - back to stability  


## Monomyth
Heroes Journey by Joseph Campbell:   
**You** >  **Need** > **Go** > **Search** >  **Find** >  **Take** >  **Return** >  **Change**  

Not relevant for series


## Other structures ....



#### Introduction
- roznicza miedzy pokazywaniem tajemnicy / wprowadzaniem motywów a randomem
- cold open (start in adventure)


#### Premise
- Meaningful, Promise, announce (in the end subtle inversion to promise )
- Promise > Progress > Payoff

#### Twist

#### Payoff
- payoff should give u everything from premies of begininig
character how will change    


#### Cycles
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!

try fail
   fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promisied not unexpected change  
   change


## Games structure

Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.

## The Seven Basic Plots
Theory developed by Christopher Booker
a Jung-influenced analysis of stories and their psychological meaning.


|||
|--|--|
Overcoming the Monster | Sets out to defeat an antagonistic force (often evil) which threatens the protagonist and/or protagonist's homeland.   
Rebirth | An event forces the main character to change their ways and often become a better individual.
The Quest | Acquire an important object or to get to a location. They face temptations and other obstacles along the way.  
Voyage and Return | Goes to a strange land and, after overcoming the threats it poses or learning important lessons unique to that location, they return with experience.   
Rags to Riches | Poor protagonist acquires power, wealth, and/or a mate, loses it all and gains it back, growing as a person as a result
Tragedy | Fall of fundamentally good character
Comedy | Dramatic work in which the central motif is the triumph over adverse circumstance, resulting in a successful or happy conclusion.  conflict becomes more and more confusing, but is at last made plain in a single clarifying event.

# Exposition
Coincidence are bad in story


**Seeding**   
Spreading tiny bits of exposition

**Payoff**   
Response   

**Foreshadowing**   
Plant idea ahead and earlier to connect later  


### Show vs Tell
Showing dramatizes / telling summarize

- dont show monseter but causes it makes


###### Stronger showing
Show it don't tell it “Talk is cheap.” Actions speak louder than words

- use evidence for claims
- emotions are complex concept and must be shoiwn with details

(as long as it character think its ok)

# Ludo narrative Harmony

# Lore
Themes / levels /   
What is about / what thread bind it together

###### Scope
To much stories in witch the fate of the world was at stake
Bigeger stakes not equal more powerfull stories


## Pace layers
- **Pacing**, **Build up** Stimulus delta over moments. Surprise changes moment to moment and our desire.

- make story on various level of magnification
6 layers that function simultaneously at different speeds within society by Stuart Brand  and (architect Frank Duffy)
