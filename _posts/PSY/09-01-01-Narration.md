Everything should fit
Martin Heidegger


You cant derive odd from is - no matter how much information u have .
# Medium
Stories define how we consume information,  create emotional experience, expand our view of the world. Telling stories is in human nature.    

Every medium have it own narrations styles, varying on genres and format (series, shorts...). Linear narrative is not enough for games. See or listen not as powerful as play themselves.
Structure in games is not as important.



Stories emerge from our consciousness and observing ourselves and understand what is what we are doing.
Successful life when you family, survive and thrive

Games and stories share a lot in common

Postacie i zdarzenia nie są ważne ze względu na swe cechy jednostkowe, mają wagę jako przykłady uniwersalnych prawideł ludzkiej egzystencji, postaw wobec życia i kolei losu. Świat przedstawiony przypowieści to zbiór sytuacyjnych wykładników jakiejś ogólnej prawdy moralnej, Fabuła z racji swego przykładowego charakteru  pozostaje silnie uschematyzowana i uboga w realia, które podlegają tu rygorystycznej selekcji ze względu na nadrzędny sens utworu. Właściwa interpretacja przypowieści wymaga przejścia od jej znaczenia literalnego do ukrytego znaczenia alegorycznego (alegoria) lub moralnego.

## Games


Push to act - Need to act. Engage with external   


---
# Premise
single core statement. 'Latin words, meaning to put before' the foundation of story,
- Meaningful, Promise, announce (in the end subtle inversion to promise )

premises tend to express—a premise statement is often a familiar expression or cliché

**thematic idea**   drives its structure and delivery   
**Elevator pitch**  



#  Story
**Story  tells who and what** -  Series of events recorded in their chronological order,  sequence of events. Story includes all of the events described that make up a narrative.  What is the topic, what are the issue. Story is more than one idea.


  - Unique story or have a twist or something to say.    
circumstances

#  Plot
**Plot tells how** With story in mind, you can decide how to plot it. Series of events deliberately arranged so as to reveal their dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance, and create tension.  

**Umbrella plot**  we will do x because core plot of genre

Action   

# Narration
**Narrative tells why** Interpretation of the events within the story. point of view of the story. Gameplay, dialog, notes, setting, graphics

**Explicit** - cutscenes text written    
**Implicit** - player must figure out itself     
**Emergent** -  Emerge from system   
**Environmental narration** -    

- Point of view
  - **1st** -  I / Me / My - Character is telling the story. connection, access to thoughts. share emotions, strong characterization but: restricted to one character, difficult .filter words to show perspective of character
  - **2nd** -  You / Your - Narrator speak to the reader.
  - **3rd** -  She / He Her / His - External narrator is telling the story.

### Narrator

Commentator / Interviewer

||||
|---|---|---|
|Ontology | homodiegetic (within world)| heterodiegetic (outside (commentary/hud))
|Shapedness | personal | non-personal
|Knowledge | restricted | omnipotent
|Story world facts | representing (represents exiting world) | stipulating  (stipulates story through narration)



### Character vs plot driven story
Without internal conflict plot have no meaning - why it matters  
character as agent of change.  

**Character driven story** - inner transformation and relations with other why something matters to character giving his desires and fears  Move story through action and choices  
**Plot is external conflict**  - what's happened. Events of the story move story forward and cause character to react    



mirror neurons




### Narrative vs mechanics driven:  
How much power over the world  

**Game story domination**  -   
**Player story domination** -     


# Experience
- as an end itself

---

#  Holistic Structure

Cannot say a story without **Place**, **Time** and **Character**. Or you can

- plot relevancy - only add essentials that matter. to much - boring, to little - implausible
- every question brought by the plot is an promise , keep best to keep those promises
- every step in journey should bring you little bit to final
- sense of progress from ballet point to bullet point > sections.
- moment goal reach story is over
- Promise > Progress > Payoff

##### Introduction / Beginning
- to engage
- roznicza miedzy pokazywaniem tajemnicy / wprowadzaniem motywów a randomem
- cold open (start in adventure)

play with expectation,  

##### Peak / Twist

- **** -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)  

##### End / Payoff
- payoff should give u everything from premise of beginning
character how will change    
- brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory    



## Three-Act structure
**Setup** > **Conflict** > **Resolution**  
Plot points are between phases  


## Narrative Arc
Narrative arc make  viewer curious how story will end

**Exposition** - settings and places   opening  during the story object can inherit meaning and emotional value    
**Rising Action** - move plot forward, establish conflict     
**Climax** - tensest moment of crisis  , confrontation  
**Falling Action** - move toward ending   denouement  
**Resolution**  - back to stability  



## Games structure

Second to second   
Minute to minute   
Hour to Hour   

Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.


[//]: # (https://frictionalgames.blogspot.com/2014/04/4-layers-narrative-design-approach.html)


Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.

#### Cycles
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!

try fail
   fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change


#### Endgame




# Structure II: Elements

Coincidence are bad in story

Show a little details that can paint a greander picture.


**Seeding**   
Spreading tiny bits of exposition

**Payoff**   
Response   

**Foreshadowing**   
Plant idea ahead and earlier to connect later  

## Exposition

### Exposition Scene in cinema

- Create a desire to know by arousing curiosity. With hunger for information even most complicated set of dramatized facts will pass smoothly into understanding.
- Dave the best for last
- Deliver suprises based on established rules
[Story by: Robert McKee]

Dialog or action - whitch mopve plot forroward
Scenes  włozone dla wyjasnienie jak jest plot hole
exposition by narration  ??

### Show and Tell writing

**Showing** dramatizes - emotions opinions sensations. deeper and details to feel more connecting to experience      
**Telling** summarize -  “Talk is cheap.” Actions speak louder than words    
[Craft of Fiction by: Perry Tubbock]

As long as it character think its ok, if it sounds like author butting into explain things you've probably fallen into telling [Understanding Show, Don't Tell by: Janice Hardy]     


Stronger showing:
- Don't show monster but causes it makes u scared
- Avoid opinion related adjectives like:  beautiful
- use evidence for claims and let them go to conclusion You want to make. 2+2
- emotions are complex concept and must be demonstrated with concrete details.  showing with details

# Dramatic elements


|||
|--|--|
Focus |  energies into achieving the given goals or objectives of a character in a scene
Tension | development of tension usually parallels the advancement of the plot, leading to a crisis or climax. Tension is closely linked with timing
Timing |  to create contrast in a scene or simply to demonstrate robotic, stylised and non-naturalistic movements. Rhythm and pace are affected
Rhythm | timing and pace of the drama. It also means the beat or tempo h. Rhythm can follow the emotional state
Contrast  | Without the careful use of contrast a performance is boring and lacks tension. A manipulating the drama to create a change in setting, use of space or rhythm. The pace of scenes can also be altered, as can various dramatic elements within one small section of a performance
Mood & Atmosphere|  ambience or aura  
Space | such as sitting, bending over, lying down or crawling. Of course, using the space around
Language |
Sound |  
Symbol | greater meaning than the literal suggestion. ie Color

Dramatic moments happening  on screen (cutscenes) are less dramatic because you just look without a control

The Quest | Acquire an important object or to get to a location. They face temptations and other obstacles along the way.  
Voyage and Return | Goes to a strange land and, after overcoming the threats it poses or learning important lessons unique to that location, they return with experience.

Tragedy | Fall of fundamentally good character
Comedy | Dramatic work in which the central motif is the triumph over adverse circumstance, resulting in a successful or happy conclusion.  conflict becomes more and more confusing, but is at last made plain in a single clarifying event.

premise and setting of story make sense with actions you perform
- It only appear when player can interact with world in meaningful for a story way. feel game through the gameplay
how themes are communicated through the gameplay

## Paradox of control
key element of enjoyment
how to offer meaningful choice  without offering full control.
