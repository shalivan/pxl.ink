Addictions !
dopamine feadback  - (social media )

needs, wants or desires acquired through influence or may be generally innate.
most important reasons to move forward
Shot of dopamine is not needed,




```
- Explicit & Implicit Motives -  - Implicit & Biological =
Unconscious Motivation
Priming
  needs as moteves (want) , needs as requirementes (need )

```



# Terms


immersion - teleport mind   
presence - teleport body    
engagement - mental or manual effort meets interactivity  (not in books)  



## Attention
Selective concentration on a discrete stimulus while ignoring other perceivable stimuli. Affect Cognitive load: (amount of mental effort being used)

`Area of focus` of brain is like thumb of hand in front of u

## Engagement  
Psychological presence. According to his definition, engagement refers to the state in which individuals express their entire self  `Flow` / the `Zone` / `Immerse`: altered time. fully `immersed` with mechanics while challenge and tension in balance  (anxiety vs boredom)

- primal forces
- context depended
- expose things to promote them
- predictable

if you lost a momentum from one moment to next and persist in that state

## Agency
????!!!!!


## Entertain
things happening > its excitement its entertainment


## Drive

- (ciekawosc?)   


###  Flow  
`Game Follow` - is wave zone between anxiety and boredom (sometimes challenge and sometimes powerful)  
- `Difficulty Curve` - Challenge  
- `Pacing` Rhythm + Pressure >Manage stress. If there is no stress its not meaningful and you don't care. So pressure is good  
- `Learning Curve` - Onboarding > tutorials super important

#  Biological

`Impulses`, `Power`, `Achievement`, `Affiliation`
  Biological motives include hunger, thirst, the pursuit of pleasure, and the avoidance of pain

## Neuroscience

- `directional` (such as directed towards a positive stimulus or away from a negative one)
- `activated` "seeking phase" and consummatory "liking phase."

 Dopamina

## Behavioral
Behaviorism is theory of motivation focused on how the results we’ve obtained from past behaviors shape our future behaviors (Environmental Shaped & Learned Drives) In this theory internal needs of individuals can be ignored. Reinforcement needs to be more than a one-off event.

- Positive Reinforcement
- Negative Reinforcement.
- Punishment.
- Extinction.
d gain. (continous login bonus) (good Dorprate in consumables items)

### Continuous Reinforcement
All responses are reinforced
happens when the desired behavior is reinforced each time it is observed. continuous reinforcement is the quickest way to get someone to develop a new behavior.

### Intermittent  Reinforcement

Some responses are reinforced

| |Interval (after time)|Ratio (after action)|
|--|--|--|
__Fixed__  Predictable | kill > loot spawn, stamina (building up high peak and quick drop)  | One more turn. clickers,  turn based building time (short post reinforcement pause)
__Variable__ Unpredictable |  public events (moderate study response pattern) | Gambling. Loot drops, Crit hits  (high stady response pattern, small bumps)


### Contingent
- `Not-Contingent` - not related to behavior (suprice gifts), not controled
- `Task-Contingent` - rewarding: `engagement`, `completion`, `perdormance`. Sense of progression - task releated motivate more contingent outcomes are not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.




### Feadback
feadback on action is reward  !!!
reward timeing and (un)certanity - immediate for success progress and choice
delayed feedback need stronger support
nitr geting rew u expect could become punishment   

`Representative Heuristic` - Time/Cost/Effort > Up expectation for reward . (Procedural like roguelikes play agianst it sometimes)  balanced economy   




- reward can be demotivating
- Unexpected reward are motivating
- Expectations. After bad luck we expect payout (gambling).
- Representative expectations - (Ngram colors in destiny)
- Loss Aversion: Something I have > Something I could have

#  Personal



Personalities
Personality traits OCEAN
Temperament
Myers-Briggs / 16 Personalities

[Personalities](/personality/)   



 which categories of goal (needs) motivate people,

Content theories    
 - **Maslow** - `Physiology` (hunger, thirst, sleep, etc.) > `Safety`/`Security`/`Shelter`/`Health` > `Social`/`Love`/`Friendship` > `Self-esteem`/`Recognition`/`Achievement` > `Self actualization`/`achievement of full potential`
 - **Two factors** - job satisfaction (motivators), while others (hygiene factors)
 - **ERG** - existence, relatedness, and growth,
 - **Intrinsic and Extrinsic** `Intrinsic` (internal or inherent) motivation, `Extrinsic` (external) motivation. inspired by outside forces



## SDT
Self Determination Theory
 Depend on context and not account for all human behavior. Can shift by different framing. OLD: `Intrinsic` -  Personal Gratification. last longer. rate higher! better (autonomy, agency, progression, feedback, opportunity). But can feel bad i.e. if you are obligated to your self vs. `Extrinsic` - External. Rewards shape to do but risk of shifting motivation. Use when needed (money) But! can feel autonomous if enough choices

`Autonomous` - (self determinate) vs. `Controlled` - (non self determinate) Illusion of control is as good as real contr.


| SDT | |
|--|--|
Competence  |sense of progression, sense of being in control Interact with activities. everyone want be best
Autonomy | self expression or meaningful:  choice (not satisfy by chose)
Relatedness |  cooperation or competition. Rank relation. (knowledge where I fit)

## PENS
Player Experience of Needed Satisfaction


| PENS | ||
|--|--|--|
Competence  | Challenge, Easy to learn difficult to master  | skill: survival, crafting
Autonomy | Choice, Customization, Agency, Freedom, Control | your world, your creations
Relatedness | Connecting, Social grouping, Status feedback  | shared experiences, public canvases


```
##### Tips  
- show purpose before giving reward Goals must be `meaningful`! for players     '
- after meaningful actions clear goals. Why important
- show value / personalize
- more effort / time needed, greater reward expected     
- absence is like a punishment    
- intermitted intervals for forming habits  
- fixed ration to sense of mastery   
- variable ratio for excitement  
- reward is not an ending but starting point  
- help player feel being in control
- Illusion of control is as good as real contr. Loosing control can be mechanic as well: Stanley Parable.

## SDT vs MDT



||MDT| SDT|
|---|---|---|
Theme of crucial need| Power| Autonomy
Individual differences | Wanting - Individual differences| Needing - No differences in need strength
Hypotheses about the effects of need satisfaction|Matching hypothesis: Motive × Environment interac-tion predicts motivation and well‐being|Universality hypothesis: Satisfaction of basic needs has similar (positive) effects for everybody
Implicit vs. explicit | Implicit vs. explicit motives |NA
Access to needs and measurement|Unconscious, indirect assessment: PSE, OMT |Conscious, direct assessment: self‐reports
Evolutionary basis |Variation in motive strength through learning |Basic needs are represented within the genome of every human being
Neurohormonal basis| Motives are associated with specific hormones| No explicit assumptions about neurohormonal basis of needs
Hope vs. fear |Differentiation into hope and fear components of implicit motives|NA

## Gamer motivation profile

|Gamer motivation profile | High | Low |
|--|--|--|
`Community` | Teamwork - community driven sacrifice control   | Independence
`Competition`  | High conflict, duels social comparison | Non-adversarial - no ranks Cooperation
`Excitement` | Fast Paced, surprises |
`Destruction`| Chaos | No weapons, no explosions
`Completion` | Task oriented (Get all collectables) | Sandbox (most age stable motivation)   
`Power`| Level up, grind character / equipment    | Static level and flat progress
`Strategy` | Thinking ahead  |    
`Challenge`  | Practice, high difficulty skill based | Easy fun  
`Fantasy` | Being someone else  |    
`Story` | Scripted drama, character | Open Ended Plot
`Discovery` | Hidden curious explore   | Full exposed minimal unknow
`Design` | Customization | Expression  

Motivation GDC:  

Novelty - Fantasy/realism.  Build/explore  
Challenge - Skilled/No  Work/not work  
Harmony -  mechanics/context   cooperation/conflict  
Stimulation - single/multi   calm/thrill

## Cultural
### FOMO





## Multiplayer
Guilds/ clans
Cooperation give chance for Positive externalities (benefit for others)

# Choice

**Locus of control** is a psychological concept that refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives.

paradox of choice - we can be happier with less choices


- more information player have more meaningful is choice
- changing decision need effort thou is more difficult with time pass
- intended `influences` (disneyland/vegas) / not intended `options` (autonomy)
- make secondary order decisions.

##### availability heuristic  (of memory)
- more we know (familiarity breeds liking)
- vivid choice (sth is present is more likely)
- cost with make decision its why we don't change our minds  (+ sank effort in already chosen path)
- like is unconscious is therefor likely that is what you want

##### prionciples of how we choose:
>less about choice more to conform mind in feeling we are in control. we are always in way from A to B. so its ok to be linear
- choices is not:
agency - capacity to chose
autonomy - capacity to make decisions  (multiplayer huge autonomy)

# Satisfaction
1) challange   
- chelenging task
- flow state > zom  
release neurotransmiters : `dopamin` `serotonin` `endorphines`
x

McGurk effect - takje video of important context of hearing audio
book: `satisfaction`  Gregory Berns

2) feadback  
sounds satisfaing because of feadback. even small delay can  estroy effect


3) recognize  
if we know the meaning and can recogniz e interpret or understand
https://youtu.be/qr0JMv2uYxQ

brain have idea and it must fit to reality. To meet expectations is important  
Illusion of control is just as much impact as real

rewards can be demotivated:

overjustification:  
- les interes dwawing if later no rewards
- les creaticve more prone to cheat
- les motivated if reward stop

#  Emotion


Psychosomatic evaluative responses based on automatized value-judgements.


>Emotions are motivations by `Discovery, novelty, surprises`

`Game Feel` - is it seem real, does mechanics allow us to do sth. feeling of competence and growth mastery   
`Interaction` - is positive


People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

### Mood

Affect is nmotr emotion is feeling is everything is ok u fill ok.


##### Toxicity
- Anonymity
- Significant time involved
- Latch opportunities by teammates mistakes
- Dunning-Kruger Effect

(For kids short videos are worse than long because of shortening attention span)



central to game design
- addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation
-  motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.
