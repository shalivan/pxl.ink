# Medium
- See or listen not as powerful as play themselves
- Every medium have it own narration style. Linear narrative is not enough for games.

#  Plot
(unique story or have a twist or sth to say. Try to implement plot in mechanics)
Telling stories is in human nature.

**Story** the story tells who and what. is a series of events recorded in their chronological order. a sequence of events,  The story includes all of the events described that make up a narrative.  
**Plot** the plot tells how. Once you have a story in mind, you can decide how you are going to plot it. is a series of events deliberately arranged so as to reveal their dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance. And create tension.  
**Narrative** the narrative tells why.  is the interpretation of the events within the story. point of view of the story.

## Structure
#### Place, Time, Character
Cannot say a story without **Place**, **Time** and **Character**. Or you can :> ?
- **Premise** -  Meaningful, Promise, announce
- **Causality** -  Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)
- **Character** revile when human characters make choices under pressure
-  **Establish conflict**, **Twist**
- **Pacing**, **Build up** Stimulus delta over moments. Surprise changes moment to moment and our desire.

Memorable moments:
- **Beginning** - to engage   
- **Peak** -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)  
- **End** - brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory    


#### Monomyth
  Heroes Journey: **You**, **Need**, **Go**, **Search**, **Find**, **Take**, **Return**, **Change**  (Joseph Campbell)
  - What with serials and games ? Its less relevant.

#### 4-Layers in games
  1. what am I doing and how
  2. narrative goal (short term) gratifications
  3. Narrative background. How my knowledge increase
  4. Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.
