## Structure
#### Place, Time, Character
Cannot say a story without **Place**, **Time** and **Character**. Or you can :> ?
- **Premise** -  Meaningful, Promise, announce
- **Causality** -  Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)
- **Character** revile when human characters make choices under pressure
-  **Establish conflict**, **Twist**
- **Pacing**, **Build up** Stimulus delta over moments. Surprise changes moment to moment and our desire.

Memorable moments:
- **Beginning** - to engage   
- **Peak** -  (tentpole - most expensive mom)  
- **End** - brain reference to those experience and have impact to long term memory    


#### Monomyth
  Heroes Journey: **You**, **Need**, **Go**, **Search**, **Find**, **Take**, **Return**, **Change**  (Joseph Campbell)
  - What with serials and games ? Its less relevant.

#### 4-Layers in games
  1. what am I doing and how
  2. narrative goal (short term) gratifications
  3. Narrative background. How my knowledge increase
  4. Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.
