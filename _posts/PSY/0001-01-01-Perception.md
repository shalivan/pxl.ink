## Gestalt



**Gestalt Principles**

| |Principle |   |
| - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/emergencesmall.png) |Emergence | **Complex pictures from simple pattern**
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) |Reification |  **Illusory continuity** constructive or generative aspect of perception
![](/src/gestalt/multistabilitysmall.png) |Multistability | **Figure-Ground**,  pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations     
![](/src/gestalt/invariancesmall.png) |Invariance | **Objects recognition** is  independent of rotation, elastic deformations, light, component features



**Law of Perception**  
Gestalt law of pragnanz. which means ‘concise and meaningful‘

||Law |Tend to be perceived as integrated into groups if ... |  |
| - | - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)|**Simplicity** | ... is good gestalt  (Simplify for better reads)
![](/src/gestalt/proximsmall.png)|**Proximity** | ... they are near each other. (Natural grouping) | Clump of grass.
![](/src/gestalt/commonsmall.png)|**Common fate**  |... they move together. | Pixels on next movie frames
  ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png) | **Similarity** |  ... they are similar to each other
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Continuity**|  ... they are aligned with each other (integrated into perceptual wholes)
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) | **Closure**|  ... they are parts of a closed figure
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Symmetry**| ... symmetry occurs (overwhelm perception). | Linear, radial, asymetry
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Past experience** | ... they were together often in the past experience of the observer |
