## Gestalt



**Gestalt Principles**

| |Principle |   |
| - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/emergencesmall.png) |Emergence | **Complex pictures from simple pattern**
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) |Reification |  **Illusory continuity** constructive or generative aspect of perception
![](/src/gestalt/multistabilitysmall.png) |Multistability | **Figure-Ground**,  pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations     
![](/src/gestalt/invariancesmall.png) |Invariance | **Objects recognition** is  independent of rotation, elastic deformations, light, component features




**Law of Perception**  
Gestalt law of pragnanz. which means ‘concise and meaningful‘

||Law |Tend to be perceived as integrated into groups if ... |  |
| - | - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)|**Simplicity** | ... is good gestalt  (Simplify for better reads)
![](/src/gestalt/proximsmall.png)|**Proximity** | ... they are near each other. (Natural grouping) | Clump of grass.
![](/src/gestalt/commonsmall.png)|**Common fate**  |... they move together. | Pixels on next movie frames
  ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png) | **Similarity** |  ... they are similar to each other

![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) | **Closure**|  ... they are parts of a closed figure
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Symmetry**| ... symmetry occurs (overwhelm perception). | Linear, radial, asymetry
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Past experience** | ... they were together often in the past experience of the observer |

more easly we can understood by what it do than by its properties

# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

What to do to improve a quality of judgement

Chapters:
1. distinction of automatic of 1 and controlled of 2. Core of system 1 create coherent interpretation what's going on. What underlay intuition and how it influence judgement
2. Study of judgement statistic. Why its hard to think statistically (sys 1 is not god)
3. limitation of our mind. Confidence what we believe we know. and hard to acknowledge how lo we know. Overconfidence because of (nie widzimy dużo i myslimy ze to wsystko co jes t)
4. economic. Model of choice deviate from rationality. Decvisions are driven bym inconsequential features of.
5. recent search. distinction EXPERIENCED cell and REMEMBERING cell. (2 experiences: 1 longer, we can exploit remembering cell)

##### Distinctions in book:
1. Experiaence cell , emember cell
2. agents in clasical economics and behavioral economics
3. Automatic sys 1, efortful sys 2


## Introduction
- easier to see errors of others (objective observers more likely detect our errors)
- systematic errors : biases (biases on intuitions)
- reliance on statistic produce bias (we have intuition for grammar but not for statistics)
- judging probability by representatives, better than by chance, sometimes stereotypes have true in it.  (ocenieanie po wygladzie)
- corruption of fought by emotions



**Attention** have limited budget to spend  
- concentrations on a task make  invisible some things (gorilla) blind to obvious and blind to our blindness  
- hard to multitask and depend on tasks  


**Intuition**  is only = recognition  
- expert intuition is real, accumulation things stored in memory  
- expert intuition can have biases as : affect  


**Media coverage bias**
- freq mentioned topics popular mind even if as other slip away from awareness.
- showing what in public mind in their view
- dramatic events and celebrities
- no stands on critical topic with less drama




## 1 Systems Distinction

- : expert and heuristic.



sys 1  fast routine
- generally we are using system 1.
- effortless choice, canbot multiplay big numbers.
- u cannot stop it. can only learn to detect
sys 2 slow
- is mobilized when sys 1 is not able to get answer (17*24)
- adopts conclusions by sys 1
- in charg of slef control. overcolme crazy decisions of sys 1  only by effort !!!



**cognitive illusions** -


## 2 Attention & Effort
```



-






system 1 have more influence than we think



## Systems Distinction
automaric  and unconc processes and how influence heuristic of judgement

control operation of syst 2

17x24 - considering if we should engage and then we have to manage complex operations and have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations

sys 2 alocate ... to includee complex computation. Agency, choice, computation

sys 1 reat to sound and give atterntion for sys 2



sys 1 continuous create suggestions
indorsed by sys 2
intuitions > believes  
impulses > voluntary actions


when sys 1 go to difficulty call to sys 2



you cannot turn off sys 1. (yo will recognize )


-------------------------
####### conflict


## Study of judgment heuristic
why is so dif to think staiscticly
tstatisctic is thinking more than 1 thing witch cannot be done in sys 1
## ignorance
overestim how much we know
and underestimate events



## 3)
## 4) experience and rememberence cells
2 painfull exp: 1 longer. but we can exploit to remember it better
