# Perception

## Gestalt



**Gestalt Principles**

| |Principle |   |
| - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/emergencesmall.png) |Emergence | **Complex pictures from simple pattern**
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) |Reification |  **Illusory continuity** constructive or generative aspect of perception
![](/src/gestalt/multistabilitysmall.png) |Multistability | **Figure-Ground**,  pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations     
![](/src/gestalt/invariancesmall.png) |Invariance | **Objects recognition** is  independent of rotation, elastic deformations, light, component features



**Law of Perception**  
Gestalt law of pragnanz. which means ‘concise and meaningful‘

||Law |Tend to be perceived as integrated into groups if ... |  |
| - | - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)|**Simplicity** | ... is good gestalt  (Simplify for better reads)
![](/src/gestalt/proximsmall.png)|**Proximity** | ... they are near each other. (Natural grouping) | Clump of grass.
![](/src/gestalt/commonsmall.png)|**Common fate**  |... they move together. | Pixels on next movie frames
  ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png) | **Similarity** |  ... they are similar to each other
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Continuity**|  ... they are aligned with each other (integrated into perceptual wholes)
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) | **Closure**|  ... they are parts of a closed figure
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Symmetry**| ... symmetry occurs (overwhelm perception). | Linear, radial, asymetry
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Past experience** | ... they were together often in the past experience of the observer |

# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)
- fast : expert and heuristic. efortless choice
- slow:

## Introduction
- easier to see errors of others
- systematic errors : biasses
biasses on intuitions a lot of this book.
- objective observers more likley detect our errors
- we have intuition for grammar but not for statistics
- relaiance on statistic produce bias
expert intuition is real, accumulation things stored in memory
expert intuition can have biases as : affect
**intuition**  is only = recognition

sytsem 1 have more influence than we think

most od book is of sys 1 and mutual interwork

## Systems Distinction
automaric  and unconc processes and how influence heuristic of judgement
control operation of syst 2

17x24 - considering if we should ingage and then we have to manage complex operations and have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations

sys 2 alocate ... to includee complex computation. Agency,m choice, computation

sys 1 reat to sound and give atterntion for sys 2

limited budget of **attention** to spend
- concentrantion on a tsask make  invisible some things (gorilla ) blind to ovious and blind to our blindness
- hard to multitask and depend on tasks

sys 1 contionous creat suges
indorsed by sys 2
intuitions > believes  
oimpulses > volountary actions

sys 2 adopts concludion by sys 1
when sys 1 go to dificulti call to sys 2
sys 2 is mobilized when sys 1 is not able to get answer (17*24)

you cannot turn off sys 1. (yo will recognize )

####### conflict


## Study of judgment heuristic
why is so dif to think staiscticly
tstatisctic is thinking more than 1 thing witch cannot be done in sys 1
## ignorance
overestim how much we know
and underestimate events



## 3)
## 4) experience and rememberence cells
2 painfull exp: 1 longer. but we can exploit to remember it better
