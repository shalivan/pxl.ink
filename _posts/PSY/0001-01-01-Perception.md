## Gestalt



**Gestalt Principles**

| |Principle |   |
| - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/emergencesmall.png) |Emergence | **Complex pictures from simple pattern**
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) |Reification |  **Illusory continuity** constructive or generative aspect of perception
![](/src/gestalt/multistabilitysmall.png) |Multistability | **Figure-Ground**,  pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations     
![](/src/gestalt/invariancesmall.png) |Invariance | **Objects recognition** is  independent of rotation, elastic deformations, light, component features




**Law of Perception**  
Gestalt law of pragnanz. which means ‘concise and meaningful‘

||Law |Tend to be perceived as integrated into groups if ... |  |
| - | - | - |- |
![](/src/gestalt/simplicitysmall.png)|**Simplicity** | ... is good gestalt  (Simplify for better reads)
![](/src/gestalt/proximsmall.png)|**Proximity** | ... they are near each other. (Natural grouping) | Clump of grass.
![](/src/gestalt/commonsmall.png)|**Common fate**  |... they move together. | Pixels on next movie frames
  ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png) | **Similarity** |  ... they are similar to each other
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Continuity**|  ... they are aligned with each other (integrated into perceptual wholes)
![](/src/gestalt/reificationsmall.png) | **Closure**|  ... they are parts of a closed figure
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Symmetry**| ... symmetry occurs (overwhelm perception). | Linear, radial, asymetry
 ![](/src/gestalt/empty.png)  | **Past experience** | ... they were together often in the past experience of the observer |

- more easily we can understood by what it do than by its properties
- Humans bad in accepting loses


# Memory




# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

What to do to improve a quality of judgement



- easier to see errors of others (objective observers more likely detect our errors)
- systematic errors : biases (biases on intuitions)
- reliance on statistic produce bias (we have intuition for grammar but not for statistics)
- judging probability by representatives, better than by chance, sometimes stereotypes have true in it.  (ocenieanie po wygladzie)
- corruption of fought by emotions



**Attention** have limited budget to spend  
- concentrations on a task make  invisible some things (gorilla) blind to obvious and blind to our blindness  
- hard to multitask and depend on tasks  


**Intuition**  is only = recognition  
- expert intuition is real, accumulation things stored in memory  
- expert intuition can have biases as : affect  


**Media coverage bias**
- frequently  mentioned topics popular mind even if as other slip away from awareness.
- showing what in public mind in their view
- dramatic events and celebrities
- no stands on critical topic with less drama




## 1 Systems Distinction



Generally we are using system 1 which have more influence than we think, u cannot stop it. can only learn to detect  


#### System 1  
Core of system 1 create coherent interpretation what's going on, continuously creating suggestions. Not good in statistic
- Fast
- Automatic
- intuitions  
- impulses   
- routine
- Effortless choice


#### System 2
When sys 1 go to difficulty (is not able to get answer) call to sys 2  
- Slow
- Believes  
- Voluntary actions  
- Effortful
- self control
- Adopts conclusions by sys 1
- in charge of self control
- Capable of work with data include complex computation. Agency, choice, computation (have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations)

## Attention & Effort
overcome crazy decisions of sys 1  only by effort


**Cognitive illusions**

you cannot see lines equal even you know they are .
to resist t only can learn mistrust impressions
recall what you know about it. but will still see as illusion.

## Study of judgment heuristic
why is so dif to think staiscticly
tstatisctic is thinking more than 1 thing witch cannot be done in sys 1
## ignorance
overestim how much we know
and underestimate events



## 3)
## 4) experience and rememberence cells
2 painfull exp: 1 longer. but we can exploit to remember it better


Chapters:

2. Study of judgement statistic. Why its hard to think statistically (sys 1 is not god)
3. limitation of our mind. Confidence what we believe we know. and hard to acknowledge how lo we know. Overconfidence because of (nie widzimy dużo i myslimy ze to wsystko co jes t)
4. economic. Model of choice deviate from rationality. Decvisions are driven bym inconsequential features of.
5. recent search. distinction EXPERIENCED cell and REMEMBERING cell. (2 experiences: 1 longer, we can exploit remembering cell)

##### Distinctions in book:
1. Experience cell , remember cell
2. agents in classical economics and behavioral economics




What underlay intuition and how it influence judgement
