qualia (/ˈkwɑːliə/ or /ˈkweɪliə/; singular form: quale) are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.



[Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)

 Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Christopher Alexander  -
‘Unselfconscious design’ (or ‘craft-based’ design) concerns the use of traditional building methods, in which the designer works directly on the form (so, if you were a wheelwright, the wheel) unselfconsciously, through a complex two-directional interaction between the context and the form, in the world itself. The design rules and solutions are largely unwritten, and are learnt informally. The same form is made over and over again with no need to question why; designers need only learn the patterns.

[Ludology](/ludology/)  

```

structure of game   
emergent narrative - interlocking mechanics , consistant, allow to investigate and came bacek.    
replayabliity   
novelity   
exploration  
roleplay  
mastery  
```

```
dynamic organisation building and repairing   
villains withg procedural goals

player-facing:
- exposition
- iinverstigaiton
- saction
- reaction / reprisal


game styles:
guiding by AI - have high saliency


---------------
 Procedural Narrative Generation:

Prioritizes agent spontniety (all imporvisation and simulation ) (Dwarf Fortress) <> Priotitize authorial structure (Adventures )
- simulation crntric approach  
- plot centric approach  

- where is locus of controll... play character directly or just give direction or control one character at a time in team
[Cognition (choices)](/cognition/)

more emergent if character can suprise you ? .>

# Rules

- defining objects and concepts
- restricting actions
- determinig effects

- units, currency, objects,time,
- life's,  health, ,

# Conflict
enemies dont need to kill

## Motivation

- care about story: imply meaning, to enable discover meaning
- Give 2+2 (simple deduction)(connect the dots) - Invite Questions!!!
motivation for character
- inretnal change sth inside person. Overcoming grive / block
- external: change sth in world outside / travel / fulfill emotions


- obstacle, desire


###### Tension
crisis and climax
dyolemat niejednoznaczne rozwiazanie
balance between: anxiet  and boredom

- overpowered to much , no tention

Obstacles, Opponents, Dilemmas

###### Relationships
all vs player
all for all

# Outcome

Victory condition:
- 1 winner - else looses
- no explicit win conditions - sandboxes

- Traither mechanics.   
- working toghether towards one goal and smiultaniously win (not enough hairs when music stops) Semicoop    
- highest scores after time

win loose state is important or just engagement is ok too ..

# Controls

## Movement

>Mirrors Edge, Spiderman, Tony Hawk, Mario

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE2H5qJ8A8

## Camera (Gamatography)
(user think in euler look up down or on sides)

- Yaw, Pitch and roll
- distance from pivor
- laterral and vertical offset for framing
- fov



####  FPS
simple


####  TPS fixed:
2d scroller   
camera locked  (rails)    
top wiev: rts-top   
slajdy   

####  TPS dynamic:
thgird person - hardest to design  (fixed angels are easier to make)
- automatic gudience to not controll cam and character by player
   - cam and level work toghether
   - line of sight must be small enough to fit throuhgh level
   - swing away from obstacles (detected earlier)
   - camera must satisfy lot of constraints
   - you can change distance to player depend on angle
   - see player and enviroment
   - depth perception and distance judgeing is preaty week

# UI

**Diedests** - in world
**non Diagetic** - not in the fiction

## Inputs

Mouse, suit, brain sencores

s “PICK UP THAT CAN.” If you do, he lets you go. If you don’t, he beats you. This accomplishes two things at once. It establishes story: you’re living in an oppressive society and must do what this cop says for fear of death. Second, on a more basic level it teaches you the basic mechanics of picking objects up and throwing them in the game..

# Making games

 which can happen if they don’t ‘announce’ their entry if they spawn from out of sight


Game iterative > Greater level of complexity  

You can imagine what it may be like but you never gonna know until you actually experience it. match expectation with embodied experience. > Iterative process.



Mental Modeling
Now comes the 4th, and final, layer - Mental Modeling. The goal with this layer is to change the way the player perceives and thinks about the game
