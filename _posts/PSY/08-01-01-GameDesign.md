**reinforce throu mechanics, incentivizse throu game systems**

[Level Design](/leveldesign/), [Ludology](/ludology/), [Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)       

Gameplay Form a desired experience   
**Qualia** - are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience  
How to deal with problem: functionally, narratively and thematically  (What is a purpose of the design.   )
Why system is imporant and not a secondary value:     
Raction to action (payof get new gear / get new info )      
synergy - every element compliment eachother  

# Players

[Motivation](/motivation/), [Characters](/characters/), [Personality](/personality/)



- where is locus of controll... play character directly or just give direction or control one character at a time in team
[Cognition (choices)](/cognition/)

more emergent if character can suprise you ? .>

Nuimber of players
roles
Interaction patterns

- player vs game  single  
- coop multiple vs game  (team coop, multilateral coop )
- pvp
- coop


story multiplayer vs multiplayer story


####  Type of players:
  - Rusher
  - Sniper
  - Ninja
  - Opportunist

#### Players 'senses':  

  - See  
  - Move  
  - Shoot/Attack  
  - Take cover  
  - Hear  
  - Get Hurt  


## NPC's
- brign stisfaction, dont stole moments from player or be burden u must cary on.

OUD - Orthoigonal unit differentiation to make dynamic playspace     
villans - what mean to be offended by villan force

# Rules

- defining objects and concepts
- restricting actions
- determinig effects


---
# Resources
## Scarcity
- units, currency, objects,time,terrain,

#### Health Systems
Pool of points that get subtracted from, eventually it reaches zero, and that initializes a game-over function or increments a death counter ( **life's** ) and restarts a section of gameplay),

How much punished for mistakes

- **regenerating** -  > reward for hiding!!  and not rewarding good play. but get forroward momentum.  (it equal chances before next encounter). Cannot hurt player a little as punishment, enemies must be able to kill you
- **health packs**
 - boxes with stuff. if u have health u get ammo. Or coins to spend not always on health
- **glory kill** reward >> offensive system and encourage to play

- mixed:
  - regen last few %
  - regen when other conditions. Only if the second variable influenced by ie food is at a certain point  (minecraft)

#### Action Points
mana (actions) - spiritual or magical energy / karma / stamina  -   Non renevable / renevable




#### Upgres
- Temporal -
- Permament - tree.

#### How to get

- Loot
- Hidden in enviro

# Conflict
enemies dont need to kill

## Motivation

- care about story: imply meaning, to enable discover meaning
- Give 2+2 (simple deduction)(connect the dots) - Invite Questions!!!
motivation for character
- inretnal change sth inside person. Overcoming grive / block
- external: change sth in world outside / travel / fulfill emotions


- obstacle, desire


###### Tension
crisis and climax
dyolemat niejednoznaczne rozwiazanie
balance between: anxiet  and boredom

- overpowered to much , no tention

Obstacles, Opponents, Dilemmas

###### Relationships
all vs player
all for all

# Boundaries

# Outcome

Victory condition:
- 1 winner - else looses
- no explicit win conditions - sandboxes

- Traither mechanics.   
- working toghether towards one goal and smiultaniously win (not enough hairs when music stops) Semicoop    
- highest scores after time

win loose state is important or just engagement is ok too ..

# Controls

## Movement

>Mirrors Edge, Spiderman, Tony Hawk, Mario

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE2H5qJ8A8

## Camera (Gamatography)
(user think in euler look up down or on sides)

- Yaw, Pitch and roll
- distance from pivor
- laterral and vertical offset for framing
- fov



####  FPS
simple


####  TPS fixed:
2d scroller   
camera locked  (rails)    
top wiev: rts-top   
slajdy   

####  TPS dynamic:
thgird person - hardest to design  (fixed angels are easier to make)
- automatic gudience to not controll cam and character by player
   - cam and level work toghether
   - line of sight must be small enough to fit throuhgh level
   - swing away from obstacles (detected earlier)
   - camera must satisfy lot of constraints
   - you can change distance to player depend on angle
   - see player and enviroment
   - depth perception and distance judgeing is preaty week



##### Accessibility , easy of use
   Degree of representation vs abstracion

--------------------

# UI

**Diedests** - in world
**non Diagetic** - not in the fiction

## Inputs

Mouse, suit, brain sencores

# .
- tutorials


s “PICK UP THAT CAN.” If you do, he lets you go. If you don’t, he beats you. This accomplishes two things at once. It establishes story: you’re living in an oppressive society and must do what this cop says for fear of death. Second, on a more basic level it teaches you the basic mechanics of picking objects up and throwing them in the game..

 which can happen if they don’t ‘announce’ their entry if they spawn from out of sight

 Game iterative > Greater level of complexity  


You can imagine what it may be like but you never gonna know until you actually experience it. match expectation with embodied experience. > Iterative process.

 Procedural Narrative Generation:

Prioritizes agent spontniety (all imporvisation and simulation ) (Dwarf Fortress) <> Priotitize authorial structure (Adventures )

 Notes on the Synthesis of Form, Christopher Alexander  -
‘Unselfconscious design’ (or ‘craft-based’ design) concerns the use of traditional building methods, in which the designer works directly on the form (so, if you were a wheelwright, the wheel) unselfconsciously, through a complex two-directional interaction between the context and the form, in the world itself. The design rules and solutions are largely unwritten, and are learnt informally. The same form is made over and over again with no need to question why; designers need only learn the patterns.
