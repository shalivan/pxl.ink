rouglike
- possible week spot when permament character upgread

advanced mechanics hidden  (those u need skill knowledge timing dexterity )- advanced
shooters - startegy + mobility

```
FUNDAMENTAL
progres is key. Getting better learning.
More that feels earn, more satisfiyng - potential of things going wrong  
one of key https://youtu.be/MtzCLd93SyU?t=3884
```


```
co -op
- parallel - own single player game along
- step by step - 1 open for another
- symultinaious - both action at same time
```

**reinforce throu mechanics, incentivizse throu game systems**   
Center of gravity in game should be settled in one place     
feedback is important      
Embreace failure as a chance to create stories   
Guided by AI   - have high saliency !!   
 [Ludology](/ludology/), [Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)       

Gameplay Form a desired experience   
**Qualia** - are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience  
How to deal with problem: functionally, narratively and thematically  (What is a purpose of the design.   )
Why system is imporant and not a secondary value:     
Raction to action (payof get new gear / get new info )      
synergy - every element compliment eachother  

# Players

[Motivation](/motivation/), [Characters](/characters/), [Personality](/personality/)


**story multiplayer** vs multiplayer story


Number of players
Roles  

**Interaction patterns**
- player vs Game (single)
- Players vs Environment (multi)
- Player vs Player (multi)
- Coop multiple vs game  (team coop, multilateral coop )







####  Type of players:
  - Rusher
  - Sniper
  - Ninja
  - Opportunist

#### Players 'senses':  

  - See  
  - Move  
  - Shoot/Attack  
  - Take cover  
  - Hear  
  - Get Hurt  


## Player Character

Bridging player and character
more emergent if character can surprise you ? .>
characterization - understanding character, to resonate.
how much u know about character. what convince us to invest time in them.
personality convey thou dialog.
what would they really say.


## Non Player Character NPC's
- brign stisfaction, dont stole moments from player or be burden u must cary on.

OUD - Orthoigonal unit differentiation to make dynamic playspace     
villans - what mean to be offended by villan force  


```
queque of killing. Archer healer, normals
dela with me first
deal wieh me last
high hp low famage

Attribute differentiation
timing. of damage. sometimes take
close/ long range attack
movement

immune to some actions
local vounrability  
--------------------
who we are
who are people we are rleated to

DRAMA:
- conflict
- comebacks
- underdogs
- social structure > hierarchies
- relationships
- champions heroes&villains
- grudges&revenge

sport seasons as interactive narrative - generate stories, setup conflict.
same plot but every season have different exciting personal stories and drama.
- failure when time move forrward creates drama
- escalation to framatic climax
- neather linera or branching

```


### Enemies

## AI

good AI let u know what is intended to do
 p- predictable > player can plan  
predictable actions / unpredictable consequences. (someone run but u never  know where)   

personal AI's that have rng stats (na stałe wylosowane) - & remembering interactions with player
ecosystems for ai

# Space


## Traversing
## Exploration
(collectables inventivise )
## Level Design

#  Objectives
to get meta paterns.  

 side quests vs main plot   
#### Interactions

Aim, Arcade skills,   
Chase, Run, Race, Hide,    
Align,  Forbiden Act , Construct, Explore, Solve,  
Ressource to escape,

...





#### Restriction

|||
|---|---|
|turn based|
|real time|
|time limits|
|keys and bariers > progress|
|rpg - freedom  > expand network  / models for ai behaviour and dyplomacy,
|strategy - field (resource alocation > use )  - are mapping puzzles
|match 4 dynamics in strategy games.
|strategies - Managing points to use to win

#### Strategies
- Skill
 - action
- Smart
 - dyplomacy
 - stelf


---
# Rules

- defining objects and concepts
- restricting actions
- determining effects


---
# Resources

 exchanging resources ( Store or use now bust. )

## Scarcity
- units, currency, objects,time,terrain,

#### Health Systems
Pool of points that get subtracted from, eventually it reaches zero, and that initializes a game-over function or increments a death counter ( **life's** ) and restarts a section of gameplay),

How much punished for mistakes

- **regenerating** -  > reward for hiding!!  and not rewarding good play. but get forroward momentum.  (it equal chances before next encounter). Cannot hurt player a little as punishment, enemies must be able to kill you
- **health packs**
 - boxes with stuff. if u have health u get ammo. Or coins to spend not always on health
- **glory kill** reward >> offensive system and encourage to play

- mixed:
  - regen last few %
  - regen when other conditions. Only if the second variable influenced by ie food is at a certain point  (minecraft)

#### Action Points
mana (actions) - spiritual or magical energy / karma / stamina  -   Non renevable / renevable




#### Upgres
- Temporal -
- Permament - tree.

#### How to get

- Loot
- Hidden in enviro  

---

# Conflict
enemies dont need to kill  
War , sport - a lot of similar drama structure    
## Motivation

- care about story: imply meaning, to enable discover meaning
- Give 2+2 (simple deduction)(connect the dots) - Invite Questions!!!
motivation for character
- inretnal change sth inside person. Overcoming grive / block
- external: change sth in world outside / travel / fulfill emotions


- obstacle, desire


###### Tension
crisis and climax
dyolemat niejednoznaczne rozwiazanie
balance between: anxiet  and boredom

- overpowered to much , no tention

Obstacles, Opponents, Dilemmas

###### Relationships
all vs player
all for all

---
# Boundaries

# Outcome

Victory condition:
- 1 winner - else looses
- no explicit win conditions - sandboxes

- Traither mechanics.   
- working toghether towards one goal and smiultaniously win (not enough hairs when music stops) Semicoop    
- highest scores after time

win loose state is important or just engagement is ok too ..

# Controls


- where is locus of controll... play character directly or just give direction or control one character at a time in team
[Cognition (choices)](/cognition/)
## Movement

>Mirrors Edge, Spiderman, Tony Hawk, Mario

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE2H5qJ8A8



movement: feadback to inputs

1. `accreleration` , `max`, `deceleration`
- short acc,decc - character stiff
- long line supre meat boy or uncontrolable or hard to stop , runing on ice
6 frames to full speed - start - 3 frames stop
6x 4 - meat boy have longet
stop 3 frames is x9 times faster than mario.


2. - jump
jump height to body size
mario - x4
meatboy 6x

`climb` `hang`, `fall`

3. air friction. if you stop stic it will fall



4. dash -
- can controll in air or static
- dash canceling CELESTE
 - dash cancel in last sek turned to massive jump with momentum of dash
 - do with crouch
 - separate dash and jump to modify
 - second dash


5. climbv

Build tools not features

systemic stories - can be wider (as biproduct of system) or just complicated narratives (cannot return to town after robbing bank)
risk of crappy uunsatisfaing story - foreshadow , justification , character ark, redemption, pase -


mastery -

retreat to safty - shift tempo between atack and deense -



### Movement
controlls ? // move to mechancs ???

-------- PORUSZANIE SIE W GRACH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ----------------
mario, movements, and combos
other approach, use enviro  - repeal yourself from projectiles or enemiies
timeing  - bust speed by shooting  - rythmic action whtn delease  -  (pathless)
keep momentu by chaining  -  / hook, slide hop, (titabfall)  / quake - bunny hopping  / mirrots efge


chorisontal gameplay vs vertical

## Camera (Gamatography)
(user think in euler look up down or on sides)

- Yaw, Pitch and roll
- distance from pivor
- laterral and vertical offset for framing
- fov

https://www.theastronauts.com/2019/04/the-secrets-of-fov/

####  FPS
simple


####  TPS fixed:
2d scroller   
camera locked  (rails)    
top wiev: rts-top   
slajdy   

####  TPS dynamic:
thgird person - hardest to design  (fixed angels are easier to make)
- automatic gudience to not controll cam and character by player
   - cam and level work toghether
   - line of sight must be small enough to fit throuhgh level
   - swing away from obstacles (detected earlier)
   - camera must satisfy lot of constraints
   - you can change distance to player depend on angle
   - see player and enviroment
   - depth perception and distance judgeing is preaty week



##### Accessibility , easy of use
   Degree of representation vs abstracion

--------------------

# UI

**Diedests** - in world
**non Diagetic** - not in the fiction

Use existing mental models and make to be more intuitive

[Design](/design/)

`Perception`
information is 3 lvl processes
 - sensations
 - preception
 - cognition  
 but sometimes if u have signs (icons) it can influate how u see (gestalt) perception is subjective  
 input is processed by brain (not raw)   
`Memory `
- sences - sensory (part of perception)
- attention >>> then it go to short time memory
- then go to long term mem
forgeting curve - after 20 min 60% lost
`Attention `

## Inputs

Mouse, suit, brain sensors

s “PICK UP THAT CAN.” If you do, he lets you go. If you don’t, he beats you. This accomplishes two things at once. It establishes story: you’re living in an oppressive society and must do what this cop says for fear of death. Second, on a more basic level it teaches you the basic mechanics of picking objects up and throwing them in the game..
.#gamasutra.

- rewards
- accesalbility
- gamification



## Accessibility
- Ability to remap controls
- Subtitles - Large and contrast
- UI visuals should be clear

# Making games
peer review:  https://youtu.be/Gsh-aYdFWws?t=1376

 which can happen if they don’t ‘announce’ their entry if they spawn from out of sight

 Game iterative > Greater level of complexity  


You can imagine what it may be like but you never gonna know until you actually experience it. match expectation with embodied experience. > Iterative process.

Long/sort term decisions  
risk averse  reward

game theroy cofifig that preclude domininat  solutions - non nash equilibrium games
```

morality systems
- choices like kotor path of doing good/bad things lead to perska

- how decisions are attached to main conflict
- binary system > if u r not polite we will lock dialogs - is no go

Metroidvania is a subgenre of action-adventure video games focused on non-linear and utility-gated exploration and progression.
