Games putting us in different emotional states and challenge us.

MACRO (proteins fats carbohydrates - energy to function >> need more )
- large scale  > maps, camps, objectives

MICRO (vitamines amd minerals - micronutrions >> need less  )
- efficiency of everything u do > easier to acomplish macro
- skillshots, abbilities, position (get less damage)


Patterns across scales m2m like fractals
More that feels earn, more satisfyingly - (potential of things going wrong)   progress is key. Getting better learning. [YT GDC Sid Meier's Psychology of Game Design](https://youtu.be/MtzCLd93SyU?t=3884)


advanced mechanics hidden  (those u need skill knowledge timing dexterity )- advanced
shooters - strategy + mobility


1. Selling point - why you should play it
2. Incentive to play - why u should keep playing
 - chase a number (rank up). Mastery (self actualization) (level up score leader board)
 - story. Novelty (provide experience things that are impossible in normal world)
 - exploration & freedom  
 - emotion: fun, no real world risk / save to fail / - easy creativity / relax / escape
 - Competition -
 - social
 - feel measurable progress
 - collecting
3. Increasing, more difficult challenges - progression system progression

Long/sort term decisions  
risk averse  reward

**reinforce through mechanics, incentivizes through game systems**   
Center of gravity in game should be settled in one place     
feedback is important      
Embrace failure as a chance to create stories   
Guided by AI   - have high saliency !!   
 [Ludology](/ludology/), [Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)       

Gameplay Form a desired experience   
**Qualia** - are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience  
How to deal with problem: functionally, narratively and thematically  (What is a purpose of the design.   )
Why system is important and not a secondary value:     
Reaction to action (payoff get new gear / get new info )      
synergy - every element compliment each other  


excuse   
momentum   
payoff    

# Players

Avatar vs Character
- Avatar give mechanical context.
- Character - Emotional context.

[GDC Character creation ](https://youtu.be/4mgK2hL33Vw)


[Motivation](/motivation/), [Characters](/characters/), [Personality](/personality/)


**story multiplayer** vs multiplayer story


Number of players
Roles  

**Interaction patterns**
- player vs Game (single)
- Players vs Environment (multi)
- Player vs Player (multi)
- Coop multiple vs game  (team coop, multilateral coop )



##### co -op
- parallel - own single player game along
- step by step - 1 open for another
- simultaneous - both action at same time


####  Type of players:
  - Rusher
  - Sniper
  - Ninja
  - Opportunist

#### Players 'senses':  

  - See  
  - Move  
  - Shoot/Attack  
  - Take cover  
  - Hear  
  - Get Hurt  


## Player Character

Bridging player and character
more emergent if character can surprise you ? .>
characterization - understanding character, to resonate.
how much u know about character. what convince us to invest time in them.
personality convey thou dialog.
what would they really say.


## Non Player Character NPC's
- bring satisfaction, don't stole moments from player or be burden u must carry on.

OUD - Orthoigonal unit differentiation to make dynamic play space     
villains - what mean to be offended by villain force  


### Enemies

queue of killing. Archer healer, normals
dela with me first
deal wieh me last
high hp low famage

Attribute differentiation
timing. of damage. sometimes take
close/ long range attack
movement

immune to some actions
local vulnerability  


## AI

good AI let u know what is intended to do
 p- predictable > player can plan  
predictable actions / unpredictable consequences. (someone run but u never  know where)   

personal AI's that have RNG stats (na stałe wylosowane) - & remembering interactions with player
ecosystems for ai

[Rafał Tyl - Uncommon sense: a systemic approach to beliefs of AI agents](https://youtu.be/hoHE2QhMMuk)

AI
cheating AI
lack of situational awareness

perception > belief building (reasoning about inf from past) its hard  cause data is heterogenious >  decision makeing > action

barbara dunin-kęplicz Andrzej Szałas  MIMUW
- epistemic profiles
= rule-based resoning with belied structure
- 4QL language
- Group beliefs



- lack of data  (hidden)
- wrong answer

#  Objectives
to get meta paterns.  

 side quests vs main plot   
#### Interactions

Aim, Arcade skills,   
Chase, Run, Race, Hide,    
Align,  Forbiden Act , Construct, Explore, Solve,  
Resources to escape,

...





#### Restriction

|||
|---|---|
|turn based|
|real time|
|time limits|
|keys and barriers > progress|
|rpg - freedom  > expand network  / models for ai behavior's and diplomacy,
|strategy - field (resource allocation > use )  - are mapping puzzles
|match 4 dynamics in strategy games.
|strategies - Managing points to use to win

#### Strategies
- Skill
 - action
- Smart
 - diplomacy
 - stealth


---
# Rules

- defining objects and concepts
- restricting actions
- determining effects


---
# Resources

 exchanging resources ( Store or use now bust. )

## Scarcity
- units, currency, objects, time, terrain

#### Health Systems
Pool of points that get subtracted from, eventually it reaches zero, and that initializes a game-over function or increments a death counter ( **life's** ) and restarts a section of gameplay),

How much punished for mistakes

- **regenerating** -  > reward for hiding!!  and not rewarding good play. but get froward momentum.  (it equal chances before next encounter). Cannot hurt player a little as punishment, enemies must be able to kill you
- **health packs**
 - boxes with stuff. if u have health u get ammo. Or coins to spend not always on health
- **glory kill** reward >> offensive system and encourage to play

- mixed:
  - regen last few %
  - regen when other conditions. Only if the second variable influenced by ie food is at a certain point  (Minecraft)

#### Action Points
mana (actions) - spiritual or magical energy / karma / stamina  -   Non renevable / renevable




#### Upgres
- Temporal -
- Permanent - tree.

#### How to get

- Loot
- Hidden in enviro

# Conflict
enemies dont need to kill  
War , sport - a lot of similar drama structure    

## Motivation

- care about story: imply meaning, to enable discover meaning
- Give 2+2 (simple deduction)(connect the dots) - Invite Questions!!!
motivation for character
- inretnal change sth inside person. Overcoming grive / block
- external: change sth in world outside / travel / fulfill emotions


- obstacle, desire


###### Tension
crisis and climax
dyolemat niejednoznaczne rozwiazanie
balance between: anxiet  and boredom

- overpowered to much , no tention

Obstacles, Opponents, Dilemmas

###### Relationships
all vs player
all for all

---
# Boundaries

# Outcome

Victory condition:
- 1 winner - else looses
- no explicit win conditions - sandboxes

- Traither mechanics.   
- working toghether towards one goal and smiultaniously win (not enough hairs when music stops) Semicoop    
- highest scores after time

win loose state is important or just engagement is ok too ..

# Controls


- where is locus of controll... play character directly or just give direction or control one character at a time in team
[Cognition (choices)](/cognition/)
## Movement

>Mirrors Edge, Spiderman, Tony Hawk, Mario

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE2H5qJ8A8



movement: feadback to inputs

1. `acceleration` , `max`, `deceleration`
- short acc,decc - character stiff
- long line supre meat boy or uncontrolable or hard to stop , runing on ice
6 frames to full speed - start - 3 frames stop
6x 4 - meat boy have longet
stop 3 frames is x9 times faster than mario.


2. - jump
jump height to body size
mario - x4
meatboy 6x

`climb` `hang`, `fall`

3. air friction. if you stop stic it will fall



4. dash -
- can controll in air or static
- dash canceling CELESTE
 - dash cancel in last sek turned to massive jump with momentum of dash
 - do with crouch
 - separate dash and jump to modify
 - second dash


5. climb

Build tools not features

systemic stories - can be wider (as biproduct of system) or just complicated narratives (cannot return to town after robbing bank)
risk of crappy uunsatisfaing story - foreshadow , justification , character ark, redemption, pase -


mastery -

retreat to safty - shift tempo between atack and deense -



### Movement

controlls ? // move to mechancs ???

mario, movements, and combos
other approach, use enviro  - repeal yourself from projectiles or enemiies
timeing  - bust speed by shooting  - rythmic action whtn delease  -  (pathless)
keep momentu by chaining  -  / hook, slide hop, (titabfall)  / quake - bunny hopping  / mirrots efge


horizontal gameplay vs vertical

## Camera (Gamatography)
(user think in euler look up down or on sides)

- Yaw, Pitch and roll
- distance from pivor
- laterral and vertical offset for framing
- fov

https://www.theastronauts.com/2019/04/the-secrets-of-fov/

####  FPS
simple


####  TPS fixed:
2d scroller   
camera locked  (rails)    
top wiev: rts-top   
slajdy   

####  TPS dynamic:
thgird person - hardest to design  (fixed angels are easier to make)
- automatic gudience to not controll cam and character by player
   - cam and level work toghether
   - line of sight must be small enough to fit throuhgh level
   - swing away from obstacles (detected earlier)
   - camera must satisfy lot of constraints
   - you can change distance to player depend on angle
   - see player and enviroment
   - depth perception and distance judgeing is preaty week



##### Accessibility , easy of use
   Degree of representation vs abstracion


--------------------
- fixed angle thrid person
- dynamic angle  - colision on distance problems / many design constraints at a time. need to organize  
    - never pivot in space (orbit around avatar)
    - level design and camera must cooperate
    - global coords or quaternions to persist state  (players think in eulers)
    - `yaw`, `pitch`, (optionally `roll`) `distance`, `latteral` and `vertical offset` for framing, `fov`
    - prevent  break line of site  (all cam cuts should be more than 30 angle )
      - can swing (rotate, detect by raycast)
      - pushing away from an obstacle while player is trying to swing toward it. (then must push cam toward)
    - organize constrain in way of degree of freeedom u need. and prioretixe

# UI

**Diedests** - in world
**non Diagetic** - not in the fiction

Use existing mental models and make to be more intuitive

[Design](/design/)

`Perception`
information is 3 lvl processes
 - sensations
 - preception
 - cognition  
 but sometimes if u have signs (icons) it can influate how u see (gestalt) perception is subjective  
 input is processed by brain (not raw)   
`Memory `
- sences - sensory (part of perception)
- attention >>> then it go to short time memory
- then go to long term mem
forgeting curve - after 20 min 60% lost
`Attention `

## Inputs

Mouse, suit, brain sensors

“PICK UP THAT CAN.” If you do, he lets you go. If you don’t, he beats you. This accomplishes two things at once. It establishes story: you’re living in an oppressive society and must do what this cop says for fear of death. Second, on a more basic level it teaches you the basic mechanics of picking objects up and throwing them in the game..

## Accessibility
- Ability to remap controls
- Subtitles - Large and contrast
- UI visuals should be clear

# Overview

a-b mission Endgame

#### Cycles (gameplay loop )

**Second to second**  -   micronarrative  (momentary)  core mechanics  
**Minute to minute**  -   events, tactics and problem-solving puzzles  
**Hour to Hour**  - (structural)  game premise goal. why where  

- Compulsion loops.
- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change

.
- life cycle of agents in simulation . Dynamically changing agents  


#### Endgame
fast pase
slow pase - time to think

morality systems
- choices like kotor path of doing good/bad things lead to perska

- how decisions are attached to main conflict
- binary system > if u r not polite we will lock dialogs - is no go

# Q
What make game meaningful. is it progress save and win screen or experience itself? What game can teach us.  What kind of narration.
What we are doing why it maters and what are the consequences
