Make game long not by Time gates but by complex mechanics 

Mechanics vs Design?
Story Symbol Idea Slogan Surprise 

https://lizengland.com/blog/game-design-library/

PUZZLES:
- Alignment problem 
- Order of operation problem 


Depth vs Complexity 

EMERGENT STRATEGIES: 


in games: 

mission 
relation 
experience 


push  pull 
risk reward 
stress reliefe

Game is activity ....


GENRE (genus - category) nowodays cathegory of medium 
- semantic - by seeing 
- syntactic - by structure 
- pragmatic - whatever called by public 

MODE - structure of story (how is told) [satire,..] - brother than genre 
cam/char/cntrl  << C3

MOOD 

Practical way (otheer way around require more examples and comparision to solve basic problems like other dids in same MOOD/MODE)

STEP 1 GENRE
Over again what is doing main activity >
STEP 2  MODE
progression mechanics - why doing / what reward / 
STEP 3  MOOD
wibes/ aestetic /mood

[Sid Meiers psychology of game design](https://youtu.be/MtzCLd93SyU)


choices are only meaningful and reinforces players identity

2 SIDES OF DESIGN 
- MECHANICAL 
	-  scripted vs system 
- FICTIONAL 



extraction / waves / roug /
resources / gune type - speed reload recoil auto aim  
scary place /
try and error - souslike
telegraphing attacs

/// dont subvert expectations. to not make player desapointed ///

Exploration loop /  Combat loop

=== NEW
natural patterns lerners
- whenever we run out of things to lern we get bored
match personal interest  to easy/dificulty, to fast or slow timing, find way to cheat

paterns:
(helpfull in evolution)
- calculating odds and prediction of events
- social status pattern < most addictive
- spatial reasoning < think ahead of time and figure out puzzle
- memory - counting cards
- visceral responses
- teamwork

+ power celling - in progression
+ resource  management - how you budget power over time.
+ cost curve


Games putting us in different emotional states and challenge us.

MACRO (proteins fats carbohydrates - energy to function >> need more )
- large scale  > maps, camps, objectives

MICRO (vitamines amd minerals - micronutrions >> need less  )
- efficiency of everything u do > easier to acomplish macro
- skillshots, abbilities, position (get less damage)


Patterns across scales m2m like fractals
More that feels earn, more satisfyingly - (potential of things going wrong)   progress is key. Getting better learning. [YT GDC Sid Meier's Psychology of Game Design](https://youtu.be/MtzCLd93SyU?t=3884)


advanced mechanics hidden  (those u need skill knowledge timing dexterity )- advanced
shooters - strategy + mobility


1. Selling point - why you should play it
2. Incentive to play - why u should keep playing
 - chase a number (rank up). Mastery (self actualization) (level up score leader board)
 - story. Novelty (provide experience things that are impossible in normal world)
 - exploration & freedom  
 - emotion: fun, no real world risk / save to fail / - easy creativity / relax / escape
 - Competition -
 - social
 - feel measurable progress
 - collecting
3. Increasing, more difficult challenges - progression system progression

Long/sort term decisions  
risk averse  reward

**reinforce through mechanics, incentivizes through game systems**   
Center of gravity in game should be settled in one place     
feedback is important      
Embrace failure as a chance to create stories   
Guided by AI   - have high saliency !!   
 [Ludology](/ludology/), [Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)       

Gameplay Form a desired experience   
**Qualia** - are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience  
How to deal with problem: functionally, narratively and thematically  (What is a purpose of the design.   )
Why system is important and not a secondary value:     
Reaction to action (payoff get new gear / get new info )      
synergy - every element compliment each other  


excuse   
momentum   
payoff    

# Players

Avatar vs Character
- Avatar give mechanical context.
- Character - Emotional context.

[GDC Character creation ](https://youtu.be/4mgK2hL33Vw)


[Motivation](/motivation/), [Characters](/characters/), [Personality](/personality/)



####  Type of players:
  - Rusher
  - Sniper
  - Ninja
  - Opportunist

#### Players 'senses':  

  - See  
  - Move  
  - Shoot/Attack  
  - Take cover  
  - Hear  
  - Get Hurt  


## Player Character

Bridging player and character
more emergent if character can surprise you ? .>
characterization - understanding character, to resonate.
how much u know about character. what convince us to invest time in them.
personality convey thou dialog.
what would they really say.


## Non Player Character NPC's
- bring satisfaction, don't stole moments from player or be burden u must carry on.

OUD - Orthoigonal unit differentiation to make dynamic play space     
villains - what mean to be offended by villain force  


### Enemies

queue of killing. Archer healer, normals
dela with me first
deal wieh me last
high hp low famage

Attribute differentiation
timing. of damage. sometimes take
close/ long range attack
movement

immune to some actions
local vulnerability  


## AI

good AI let u know what is intended to do
 p- predictable > player can plan  
predictable actions / unpredictable consequences. (someone run but u never  know where)   

personal AI's that have RNG stats (na stałe wylosowane) - & remembering interactions with player
ecosystems for ai

cheating AI
lack of situational awareness

perception > belief building (reasoning about inf from past) its hard  cause data is heterogenious >  decision makeing > action

#  Objectives
to get meta paterns.  

 side quests vs main plot   
#### Interactions

Aim, Arcade skills,   
Chase, Run, Race, Hide,    
Align,  Forbiden Act , Construct, Explore, Solve,  
Resources to escape,

|rpg - freedom  > expand network  / models for ai behavior's and diplomacy,
|strategy - field (resource allocation > use )  - are mapping puzzles
|match 4 dynamics in strategy games.
|strategies - Managing points to use to win

#### Strategies
- Skill
 - action
- Smart
 - diplomacy
 - stealth


---
# Rules

- defining objects and concepts
- restricting actions
- determining effects


---



---

# Conflict
enemies dont need to kill  
War , sport - a lot of similar drama structure    

## Motivation

- care about story: imply meaning, to enable discover meaning
- Give 2+2 (simple deduction)(connect the dots) - Invite Questions!!!
motivation for character
- inretnal change sth inside person. Overcoming grive / block
- external: change sth in world outside / travel / fulfill emotions


- obstacle, desire


###### Tension
crisis and climax
dyolemat niejednoznaczne rozwiazanie
balance between: anxiet  and boredom

- overpowered to much , no tention

Obstacles, Opponents, Dilemmas

###### Relationships
all vs player
all for all

# Outcome

Victory condition:
- 1 winner - else looses
- no explicit win conditions - sandboxes

- Traither mechanics.   
- working toghether towards one goal and smiultaniously win (not enough hairs when music stops) Semicoop    
- highest scores after time

win loose state is important or just engagement is ok too ..

# Controls


- where is locus of controll... play character directly or just give direction or control one character at a time in team
[Cognition (choices)](/cognition/)
## Movement

>Mirrors Edge, Spiderman, Tony Hawk, Mario

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAE2H5qJ8A8



movement: feadback to inputs

1. `acceleration` , `max`, `deceleration`
- short acc,decc - character stiff
- long line supre meat boy or uncontrolable or hard to stop , runing on ice
6 frames to full speed - start - 3 frames stop
6x 4 - meat boy have longet
stop 3 frames is x9 times faster than mario.


2. - jump
jump height to body size
mario - x4
meatboy 6x

`climb` `hang`, `fall`

3. air friction. if you stop stic it will fall



4. dash -
- can controll in air or static
- dash canceling CELESTE
 - dash cancel in last sek turned to massive jump with momentum of dash
 - do with crouch
 - separate dash and jump to modify
 - second dash


5. climb

Build tools not features

systemic stories - can be wider (as biproduct of system) or just complicated narratives (cannot return to town after robbing bank)
risk of crappy uunsatisfaing story - foreshadow , justification , character ark, redemption, pase -


mastery -

retreat to safty - shift tempo between atack and deense -



### Movement

controlls ? // move to mechancs ???

mario, movements, and combos
other approach, use enviro  - repeal yourself from projectiles or enemiies
timeing  - bust speed by shooting  - rythmic action whtn delease  -  (pathless)
keep momentu by chaining  -  / hook, slide hop, (titabfall)  / quake - bunny hopping  / mirrots efge


horizontal gameplay vs vertical

## Camera (Gamatography)
(user think in euler look up down or on sides)

- Yaw, Pitch and roll
- distance from pivor
- laterral and vertical offset for framing
- fov

##### FOV
- FOV values can be different. 60 vertical FOV equaled 75 HOR+ FOV which is based in 4:3 aspect ratio, equals to 90 HOR- FOV which is based 16:9 aspect ratio or higher.
- 85 HOR+ FOV and not 90 is the maximum FOV that gives you peripheral vision without making a fisheye effect on 16:9 aspect ratio which is the standard now.
- **competitive gamers** that need the most FOV so they can see everything
- For **simracers**, 1:1 world accurate FOV is vitally important, and what a 1:1 FOV with no distortion is is completely dependent on how big your monitor is and how far away it is from your eyes. Think of your monitor like
- [https://dinex86.github.io/FOV-Calculator/](https://dinex86.github.io/FOV-Calculator/)

https://www.theastronauts.com/2019/04/the-secrets-of-fov/

####  FPS
simple


####  TPS fixed:
2d scroller   
camera locked  (rails)    
top wiev: rts-top   
slajdy   

####  TPS dynamic:
thgird person - hardest to design  (fixed angels are easier to make)
- automatic gudience to not controll cam and character by player
   - cam and level work toghether
   - line of sight must be small enough to fit throuhgh level
   - swing away from obstacles (detected earlier)
   - camera must satisfy lot of constraints
   - you can change distance to player depend on angle
   - see player and enviroment
   - depth perception and distance judgeing is preaty week



##### Accessibility , easy of use
   Degree of representation vs abstracion


--------------------
- fixed angle thrid person
- dynamic angle  - colision on distance problems / many design constraints at a time. need to organize  
    - never pivot in space (orbit around avatar)
    - level design and camera must cooperate
    - global coords or quaternions to persist state  (players think in eulers)
    - `yaw`, `pitch`, (optionally `roll`) `distance`, `latteral` and `vertical offset` for framing, `fov`
    - prevent  break line of site  (all cam cuts should be more than 30 angle )
      - can swing (rotate, detect by raycast)
      - pushing away from an obstacle while player is trying to swing toward it. (then must push cam toward)
    - organize constrain in way of degree of freeedom u need. and prioretixe

# UI

**Diedests** - in world
**non Diagetic** - not in the fiction

Use existing mental models and make to be more intuitive

[Design](/design/)

`Perception`
information is 3 lvl processes
 - sensations
 - preception
 - cognition  
 but sometimes if u have signs (icons) it can influate how u see (gestalt) perception is subjective  
 input is processed by brain (not raw)   
`Memory `
- sences - sensory (part of perception)
- attention >>> then it go to short time memory
- then go to long term mem
forgeting curve - after 20 min 60% lost
`Attention `

## Inputs

Mouse, suit, brain sensors


UI: https://www.gameuidatabase.com/index.php?scrn=160




# .

## Onboarding 

- tutorials


“PICK UP THAT CAN.” If you do, he lets you go. If you don’t, he beats you. This accomplishes two things at once. It establishes story: you’re living in an oppressive society and must do what this cop says for fear of death. Second, on a more basic level it teaches you the basic mechanics of picking objects up and throwing them in the game..

- rewards
- accessibility
- gamification



## Accessibility
- Ability to remap controls
- Subtitles - Large and contrast
- UI visuals should be clear

# Overview

a-b mission Endgame

#### Cycles (gameplay loop )

**Second to second**  -   micronarrative  (momentary)  core mechanics  
**Minute to minute**  -   events, tactics and problem-solving puzzles  
**Hour to Hour**  - (structural)  game premise goal. why where  

- Compulsion loops.
- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change

.
- life cycle of agents in simulation . Dynamically changing agents  


#### Endgame
fast pase
slow pase - time to think
