# Mechanics   

# Camera (Gamatography)

- Yaw, Pitch and roll
- distance from pivor
- laterral and vertical offset for framing
- fov

(user think in euler look up down or on sides)

####  FPS
simple

####  TPS fixed:
2d scroller   
camera locked  (rails)    
top wiev: rts-top   
slajdy   

####  TPS dynamic:
thgird person - hardest to design  (fixed angels are easier to make)
- automatic gudience to not controll cam and character by player
   - cam and level work toghether
   - line of sight must be small enough to fit throuhgh level
   - swing away from obstacles (detected earlier)
   - camera must satisfy lot of constraints
   - you can change distance to player depend on angle
   - see player and enviroment
   - depth perception and distance judgeing is preaty week

### gameplay scenario
a-b mission / sandbox / vechicle /

Victory condition   
Nr of players  
Game flow   
feadback      
turn / timelimits   
keys and bariers > progress   

sec to sec (momentary) / min to min / h to h (structural)   

`explicit` vs.`emergence`



better experience from discover additional value (shorter wat times ect... ). If you must wait longer its bad   






firs minute     
end (+ stick landing ) nail it!    

Dramatic moments happening  on screen (cutscenes) are less freametic because you just look without a control
