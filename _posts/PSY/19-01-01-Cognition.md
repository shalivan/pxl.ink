Cognitive effort capacity and mental load  
Emotions vs Logic

- more easily we can understood by what it do than by its properties
- Humans bad in accepting loses

# Cognitive states
How you process information  
Neuro correlate of consciousness

naturally or induced by ext factors like drugs or internal factors.   

Altered states of conciousness    

Wakefulness|Awareness - two major components of conciousness

|State|Wakefulness|Awareness||||
|----|--|--|--|--|--|
Focused Selective attention|hi |hi| | flow
Divided attention|hi|hi
Locked-In Syndrom |hi|hi

Lucid dream | low |  hi || sleepwalking
REM | mid | mid-hi | Rapid eye movement, similar brain activity to wake | dreams
Light sleep NREM1| mid | mid | some conscious about enviro | Drowsy sleep
Deep sleep NREM2|  |  | Majority of sleep, unknown purpose |

# Cognitive Dissonance

- Free choice  
- Forbidden Behavior paradigm  
- Induced compliance  
- Belief disconfirmation  
- Effort justification

# Choice

### Canonical Theory of Dynamic Decision-Making


**Locus of control** is a psychological concept that refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives.

paradox of choice - we can be happier with less choices


- more information player have more meaningful is choice
- changing decision need effort thou is more difficult with time pass
- intended `influences` (disneyland/vegas) / not intended `options` (autonomy)
- make secondary order decisions.

##### availability heuristic  (of memory)
- more we know (familiarity breeds liking)
- vivid choice (sth is present is more likely)
- cost with make decision its why we don't change our minds  (+ sank effort in already chosen path)
- like is unconscious is therefor likely that is what you want

##### principles of how we choose:
>less about choice more to conform mind in feeling we are in control. we are always in way from A to B. so its ok to be linear
- choices is not:
agency - capacity to chose
autonomy - capacity to make decisions  (multiplayer huge autonomy)

# Memory
>in brain:  hypocampus  
memory  is not stored as plasticity of synapses only. but is one aspect of formation of neuro network as well. therefor can connect with other memories.

- repetition drive memory
- to better memorize constraint to your thoughts from past
- if u starving its not good time to remembering
- stress hormones give advantages to remembrance in short time
- LTP  
- alcohol directly disrupt LTP
- categorical way of thinking is how

# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

## Systems Distinction
Generally we are using system 1 which have more influence than we think, u cannot stop it. can only learn to detect  



||System 1|System 2|
|---|---|---|
||Fast|Slow
||impulses |Voluntary actions
||routine|self control
||Effortless choice|Capable of work with data
||intuitions|Believes



Core of System 1 create coherent interpretation what's going on, continuously creating suggestions. Not good in statistic When sys 1 go to difficulty (is not able to get answer) call to sys 2. 2 is Capable of work with data include complex computation. Agency, choice, computation (have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations)


- Attention and effort
- The lazy controller
- The associative machine
- Cognitive ease
- Norms, surprises, and causes
- A machine for jumping to conclusions
- How judgments happen

##  Heuristics
and biases

- Anchors
- The science of availability
- Availability, emotion, and risk
- Tom W's specialty
- Linda : less is more
- Causes trump statistics
- Regression to the mean
- Taming intuitive predictions.

## Overconfidence
- The illusion of understanding  
- The illusion of validity  
- Intuitions vs. formulas   
- Expert intuition : when can we trust it?  
- The outside view  
- The engine of capitalism  

## Choices
- Bernoulli's errors  
- Prospect theory  
- The endowment effect  
- Bad events  
- The fourfold pattern  
- Rare events  
- Risk policies   
- Keeping score  
- Reversals  
- Frames and reality  

## Two selves
- Two selves  
- Life as a story  
- Experienced well-being  
- Thinking about life
