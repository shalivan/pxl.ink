# Cognitive states

Altered states of consciousness  occurs naturally or induced by internal or external factors like drugs

Two major components of consciousness:   
**Wakefulness** - complex thought processes  / arousal (mind)  
**Awareness** -  basic reflexes (brain)  

| State | Wakefulness | Awareness | Description ||
|----|--|--|--|--|
Focused Selective Attention | High |High| | Flow
Divided Attention | High | High | | Awake
Daydreaming| || stream of consciousness that detaches from current external tasks when attention drifts to a more personal and internal direction.
Lethargy |||causes you to feel sleepy or fatigued and sluggish
|
Meditative| Mid-high | Mid-high | passive awareness | Drowsiness
Light sleep| Mid | Mid | Some conscious about enviro | NREM1
REM | Mid | Mid | Rapid eye movement, similar brain activity to wake | Dreams
Deep sleep | Low | Low | Majority of sleep, unknown purpose | NREM2
Lucid dream | Low |  High || Sleepwalking
|
Hypnotized |
Toxicated |
|
Locked-In Syndrome |High | High
Minimally Conscious |High| Mid |Visual tracking/fix, command following (no functional communication)
Vegetative |High | Low |
|
Anesthesia |Low| Low |Eye opening | Unconscious
Coma | Lowest | Lowest || Unconscious

## Cognitive Biases

[Perception](/perception/)






Biases and fallacies are not optimal

 bias can be distinguished: information bias, selection bias, and confounding.




## Biases


The Primacy / Recency Effect is the observation that information presented at the beginning (Primacy) and end (Recency) of a learning episode tends to be retained better than information presented in the middle


|Behavioral biases |Judgments are influenced by: | (	Decision-making, belief)|
|-|-|-|
|Anchoring | first  thing you judge | First thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows| U r anchored to stock price you bought
|Availability Heuristic |   what springs most easily to mind | (something happened in same place)
|Availability Cascade |  | media report > public panic
|Sunk Cost | involved capital  |  irrationally cling to things that have already cost you something.
|
|Framing||You allow yourself to be unduly influenced by context and delivery
|Halo effect |how much you find attractive | People you like or findattractive influences your other judgments of them
|In-Group bias |group belonging| unfairly favor those who belong to your group.
|Group thinking |group thinking |social dynamics of a group situation override the best outcomes.
|Optimism, Pessimism |  | overestimate the likelihood of positive / negative outcome
|Negativity bias || negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.
|Diclinism | | remember the past as better than it was, and expect the future to be worse than it will likely be.
|Placebo|||
|
|Curse of Knowledge | presumption of others knowledge.  | Presume  that others have same knowledge. | Once you understand something you presume it to be obvious to everyone
|Dunning-Kruger effect| lack of knowledge.|The more you know, the less confident you're likely to be
|Confirmation bias  |confirming your existing beliefs. | Favor things that confirm your existing beliefs.  
|Belief bias | anything that supports actual believes | If a conclusion supports your existing beliefs, you'll rationalize anything that supports it.
|False-Consensus Effect    
|Self-serving bias |  |  failures are due to external factors, yet you're responsible for your successes.
|Backfire effect||if beliefs is challenged, it can cause you to believe even more strongly.
|Reactance |seeing other people's intentions. | do something different from what someone wants you to do in reaction to a perceived attempt to constrain your freedom of choice.
|Bystander effect|| You presume someone else is going to do something in an emergency situation.
|Fundamental Attribution error||You judge others on their character, but yourself on the situation.
|Just-world hypothesis || preference for justice makes you presume it exists.
|Spotlight effect || overestimate how much people notice how you look and act
|Barnum effect| | You see personal specifics in vague statements by filling in the gaps.
|Hindsight Bias |  |(Rationalize that something happened)
|Endowment Effect  ||(perceive effect) (Want to sell item for more)
|Duration neglect  || judgment of painful experiences depend very little on how long those experiences lasted
|Peak-End rule | |people judge an experience mostly on how they felt at its peak or very end (shortcut when thinking how feel about exp. you thing about: 1 highest peaks and at end )
|Regency Bias |  | is the phenomenon of a person most easily remembering something that has happened recently,
|Priming |exposure to a certain stimulus | Things seen recently impact you more
|Mere Exposure Effect||(More often see more u like it)
| Blind Spot|| (other feel different than you)
|Cognitive Ease |  ()
|law of Small numbers ||  (next flip have same chance )
|Prospect Theory and Loss Aversion ||(insurances , 100% money back, bnrutality in tv) (LOSS > gain)

# Memory
Hypo campus memory  is not stored as plasticity of synapses only. but is one aspect of formation of neuro network as well. therefor can connect with other memories.

- repetition drive memory
- to better memorize constraint to your thoughts from past
- if u starving its not good time to remembering
- stress hormones give advantages to remembrance in short time
- LTP  
- alcohol directly disrupt LTP
- categorical way of thinking is how

# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

https://medium.com/swlh/every-chapter-of-thinking-fast-and-slow-in-7-minutes-5e6adf89cf39

## Systems Distinction
Generally we are using system 1 which have more influence than we think, u cannot stop it. can only learn to detect  



||System 1|System 2|
|---|---|---|
||Fast|Slow
||Impulses |Voluntary actions
||Routine|Self control
||Effortless choice|Capable of work with data
||Intuitions|Believes



Core of System 1 create coherent interpretation what's going on, continuously creating suggestions. Not good in statistic When sys 1 go to difficulty (is not able to get answer) call to sys 2. 2 is Capable of work with data include complex computation. Agency, choice, computation (have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations)

# Choice



https://youtu.be/QZ3TNIPDAd8

### Canonical Theory of Dynamic Decision-Making


### Locus of control
 psychological concept that refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives.

### Paradox of choice
We can be happier with less choices


- more information player have more meaningful is choice
- changing decision need effort thou is more difficult with time pass
- intended `influences` (disneyland/vegas) / not intended `options` (autonomy)
- make secondary order decisions.

### Availability heuristic  (of memory)
- more we know (familiarity breeds liking)
- vivid choice (sth is present is more likely)
- cost with make decision its why we don't change our minds  (+ sank effort in already chosen path)
- like is unconscious is therefor likely that is what you want

### Principles of how we choose:
less about choice more to conform mind in feeling we are in control. we are always in way from A to B. so its ok to be linear
- choices is not:
agency - capacity to chose
autonomy - capacity to make decisions  (multiplayer huge autonomy)

#  Emotions & Mood


Emotions are biological states associated with all of the nerve systems


There is currently no scientific consensus on a definition. Emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity, and motivation.


Emotions produce different physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes
The original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the passing on of genes through survival, reproduction, and kin selection.


n the one hand, the physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system. Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency.

## Theories

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion

## Formation


Aroused | not aroused
negative | positive




Psychosomatic evaluative responses based on automatized value-judgements.


>Emotions are motivations by `Discovery, novelty, surprises`

Satisfaction -  well-being assessed in terms of mood, satisfaction with relationships, achieved goals, self-concepts


### .
Cognitive appraisal: provides an evaluation of events and objects.
Bodily symptoms: the physiological component of emotional experience.
Action tendencies: a motivational component for the preparation and direction of motor responses.
Expression: facial and vocal expression almost always accompanies an emotional state to communicate reaction and intention of actions.
Feelings: the subjective experience of emotional state once it has occurred.
