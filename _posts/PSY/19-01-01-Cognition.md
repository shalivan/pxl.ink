# Cognitive states


Altered states of consciousness  occurs naturally or induced by external factors like drugs or internal factors.   

Two major components of consciousness: Wakefulness Awareness

|State|Wakefulness|Awareness||||
|----|--|--|--|--|--|
Focused Selective attention|hi |hi| | Flow
Divided attention|hi|hi
Locked-In Syndrom |hi|hi
Daydreaming|
Meditative|
Hypnotised |
Toxicated |
Lucid dream | low |  hi || Sleepwalking
REM | mid | mid-hi | Rapid eye movement, similar brain activity to wake | Dreams
Light sleep NREM1| mid | mid | Some conscious about enviro | Drowsy sleep
Deep sleep NREM2|  |  | Majority of sleep, unknown purpose |
Minimally Conscious |hi| mid |Visual tracking/fix, command following (no functional communication)
Vegetative |hi | low |
Anesthesia |low| low |Eye opening
Coma |lowest | lowest

# Choice

https://youtu.be/QZ3TNIPDAd8

### Canonical Theory of Dynamic Decision-Making


### Locus of control
 psychological concept that refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives.

### Paradox of choice
We can be happier with less choices


- more information player have more meaningful is choice
- changing decision need effort thou is more difficult with time pass
- intended `influences` (disneyland/vegas) / not intended `options` (autonomy)
- make secondary order decisions.

### Availability heuristic  (of memory)
- more we know (familiarity breeds liking)
- vivid choice (sth is present is more likely)
- cost with make decision its why we don't change our minds  (+ sank effort in already chosen path)
- like is unconscious is therefor likely that is what you want

### Principles of how we choose:
less about choice more to conform mind in feeling we are in control. we are always in way from A to B. so its ok to be linear
- choices is not:
agency - capacity to chose
autonomy - capacity to make decisions  (multiplayer huge autonomy)

# Memory
Hypo campus memory  is not stored as plasticity of synapses only. but is one aspect of formation of neuro network as well. therefor can connect with other memories.

- repetition drive memory
- to better memorize constraint to your thoughts from past
- if u starving its not good time to remembering
- stress hormones give advantages to remembrance in short time
- LTP  
- alcohol directly disrupt LTP
- categorical way of thinking is how

# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

## Systems Distinction
Generally we are using system 1 which have more influence than we think, u cannot stop it. can only learn to detect  



||System 1|System 2|
|---|---|---|
||Fast|Slow
||Impulses |Voluntary actions
||Routine|Self control
||Effortless choice|Capable of work with data
||Intuitions|Believes



Core of System 1 create coherent interpretation what's going on, continuously creating suggestions. Not good in statistic When sys 1 go to difficulty (is not able to get answer) call to sys 2. 2 is Capable of work with data include complex computation. Agency, choice, computation (have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations)


- Attention and effort
- The lazy controller
- The associative machine
- Cognitive ease
- Norms, surprises, and causes
- A machine for jumping to conclusions
- How judgments happen

##  Heuristics
and biases

- Anchors *
- The science of availability *
- Availability, emotion, and risk
- Tom W's specialty
- Linda : less is more
- Causes trump statistics
- Regression to the mean
- Taming intuitive predictions.

## Overconfidence
- The illusion of understanding  
- The illusion of validity  
- Intuitions vs. formulas   
- Expert intuition : when can we trust it?  
- The outside view  
- The engine of capitalism  

## Choices
- Bernoulli's errors  
- Prospect theory  
- The endowment effect *
- Bad events  
- The fourfold pattern  
- Rare events  
- Risk policies   
- Keeping score  
- Reversals  
- Frames and reality

- Two selves  
- Life as a story  
- Experienced well-being

# Cognitive Dissonance

- Free choice  
- Forbidden Behavior paradigm  
- Induced compliance  
- Belief disconfirmation  
- Effort justification  

## Cognitive Biases

[Perception](/perception/)





# Cognitive Biases

Biases and fallacies are not optimal

 bias can be distinguished: information bias, selection bias, and confounding.

## Behavioral biases


The Primacy/Recency Effect is the observation that information presented at the beginning (Primacy) and end (Recency) of a learning episode tends to be retained better than information presented in the middle


|Behavioral biases (	Decision-making, belief) |Judgments are influenced by: ||
|-|-|-|
|Anchoring | first  thing you judge | First thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows| -
|Availability Heuristic |   what springs most easily to mind | (something happened in same place)
|Availability Cascade |  | media report > public panic
|Sunk Cost | involved capital  |  irrationally cling to things that have already cost you something.
|
|Framing||You allow yourself to be unduly influenced by context and delivery
|Halo effect |how much you find attractive | People you like or findattractive influences your other judgments of them
|In-Group bias |group belonging| unfairly favor those who belong to your group.
|Group thinking |group thinking |social dynamics of a group situation override the best outcomes.
|Optimism, Pessimism |  | overestimate the likelihood of positive / negative outcome
|Negativity bias || negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.
|Diclinism | | remember the past as better than it was, and expect the future to be worse than it will likely be.
|Placebo|||
|
|Curse of Knowledge | presumption of others knowledge.  | Presume  that others have same knowledge. | Once you understand something you presume it to be obvious to everyone
|Dunning-Kruger effect| lack of knowledge.|The more you know, the less confident you're likely to be
|Confirmation bias  |confirming your existing beliefs. | Favor things that confirm your existing beliefs.  
|Belief bias | anything that supports actual believes | If a conclusion supports your existing beliefs, you'll rationalize anything that supports it.
|False-Consensus Effect    
|Self-serving bias |  |  failures are due to external factors, yet you're responsible for your successes.
|Backfire effect||if beliefs is challenged, it can cause you to believe even more strongly.
|Reactance |seeing other people's intentions. | do something different from what someone wants you to do in reaction to a perceived attempt to constrain your freedom of choice.
|Bystander effect|| You presume someone else is going to do something in an emergency situation.
|Fundamental Attribution error||You judge others on their character, but yourself on the situation.
|Just-world hypothesis || preference for justice makes you presume it exists.
|Spotlight effect || overestimate how much people notice how you look and act
|Barnum effect| | You see personal specifics in vague statements by filling in the gaps.
|Hindsight Bias |  |(Rationalize that something happened)
|Endowment Effect  ||(perceive effect) (Want to sell item for more)
|Duration neglect  || judgment of painful experiences depend very little on how long those experiences lasted
|Peak-End rule | |people judge an experience mostly on how they felt at its peak or very end (shortcut when thinking how feel about exp. you thing about: 1 highest peaks and at end )
|Regency Bias |  | is the phenomenon of a person most easily remembering something that has happened recently,
|Priming |exposure to a certain stimulus | Things seen recently impact you more
|Mere Exposure Effect||(More often see more u like it)
| Blind Spot|| (other feel different than you)
|Cognitive Ease |  ()
|law of Small numbers ||  (next flip have same chance )
|Prospect Theory and Loss Aversion ||(insurances , 100% money back, bnrutality in tv) (LOSS > gain)
