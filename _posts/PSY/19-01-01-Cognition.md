- Forbidden Behavior paradigm  
- Induced compliance

# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

## Systems Distinction
Generally we are using system 1 which have more influence than we think, u cannot stop it. can only learn to detect  



||System 1|System 2|
|---|---|---|
||Fast|Slow
||impulses |Voluntary actions
||routine|self control
||Effortless choice|Capable of work with data
||intuitions|Believes



Core of System 1 create coherent interpretation what's going on, continuously creating suggestions. Not good in statistic When sys 1 go to difficulty (is not able to get answer) call to sys 2. 2 is Capable of work with data include complex computation. Agency, choice, computation (have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations)
