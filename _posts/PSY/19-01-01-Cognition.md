Cognitive effort capacity and mental load  
Emotions vs Logic

- more easily we can understood by what it do than by its properties
- Humans bad in accepting loses






## Cognitive Biases

Biases and fallacies are not optimal

 bias can be distinguished: information bias, selection bias, and confounding.


|Behavioral biases (	Decision-making, belief) |Tendency to:|-|
|-|-|-|
Anchoring | First thing you judge influences your judgment of all that follows | First offer sets an ‘anchor’ price which will influence how counter-offer might seem
Priming |  (what u see before )
Halo effect | How much you like someone, or how attractive they are, influences your other judgments of them
Availability Heuristic |  Judgments are influenced by what springs most easily to mind (something happened in same place)
Availability Cascade | media report > public panic
Sunk Cost | ... thing that have already cost you something.
In-Group bias | unfairly favor those who belong to your group.
|
Group thinking |social dynamics of a group situation override the best outcomes.
Framing|
Optimism, Pessimism | overestimate the likelihood of positive / negative outcome
Placebo|
|
|
Dunning-Kruger effect|
Curse of Knowledge | Presume  that others have same knowledge | Understand something is obvious to everyone get it
Confirmation bias  | Favor things that confirm your existing beliefs.  
False-Consensus Effect    
Belief bias | anything that supports actual believes
Self-serving bias |  failures are due to external factors, yet you're responsible for your successes.
Backfire effect|
Barnum effect|
Negativity bias | negative things to disproportionately influence your thinking.
Diclinism |
Fundamental Attribution error|
Just-world hypothesis | preference for justice makes you presume it exists.
Bystander effect|
Reactance |  is the tendency to do something different from what someone wants you to do in reaction to a perceived attempt to constrain your freedom of choice.
Spotlight effect | overestimate how much people notice how you look and act
Hindsight Bias | (Rationalize that something happened)
Endowment Effect |(perceive effect) (Want to sell item for more)
Duration neglect | judgment of painful experiences depend very little on how long those experiences lasted
Peak-End rule |people judge an experience mostly on how they felt at its peak or very end (shortcut when thinking how feel about exp. you thing about: 1 highest peaks and at end )
Mere Exposure Effect|
|(More often see more u like it)
Blind Spot (other feel different than you)
Regency Bias |  is the phenomenon of a person most easily remembering something that has happened recently,
`Cognitive Ease` ()
`law of Small numbers`  (next flip have same chance )
`Prospect Theory and Loss Aversion` (insurances , 100% money back, bnrutality in tv) (LOSS > gain)

## Memory
>in brain:  hypocampus  
memory  is not stored as plasticity of synapses only. but is one aspect of formation of neuro network as well. therefor can connect with other memories.

- repetition drive memory
- to better memorize constraint to your thoughts from past
- if u starving its not good time to remembering
- stress hormones give advantages to remembrance in short time
- LTP  
- alcohol directly disrupt LTP
- categorical way of thinking is how

# Thinking Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)

## Systems Distinction
Generally we are using system 1 which have more influence than we think, u cannot stop it. can only learn to detect  



||System 1|System 2|
|---|---|---|
||Fast|Slow
||impulses |Voluntary actions
||routine|self control
||Effortless choice|Capable of work with data
||intuitions|Believes



Core of System 1 create coherent interpretation what's going on, continuously creating suggestions. Not good in statistic When sys 1 go to difficulty (is not able to get answer) call to sys 2. 2 is Capable of work with data include complex computation. Agency, choice, computation (have in mind partial solutions while doing next computations)

- The lazy controller
- The associative machine
- Cognitive ease
- Norms, surprises, and causes
- A machine for jumping to conclusions
- How judgments happen

##  Heuristics
and biases

- Anchors
- The science of availability
- Availability, emotion, and risk
- Tom W's specialty

## Overconfidence
- The illusion of understanding  
- The illusion of validity  
- Intuitions vs. formulas   
- Expert intuition : when can we trust it?  
- The outside view  
- The engine of capitalism  

## Choices

- Prospect theory  
- The endowment effect
