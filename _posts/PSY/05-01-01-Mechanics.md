# Mechanics   




# Structure



[Game Design](/gamedesign/)   
[Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)   
[Game Theory](/gametheory/)   


Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.




#### Cycles (gameplay loop )

**Second to second**  -   micronarrative  (momentary)  core mechanics  
**Minute to minute**  -   events, tactics and problem-solving puzzles  
**Hour to Hour**  - (structural)  game premise goal. why where  

- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change

.
- life cycle of agents in simulation . Dynamicly changing agets  


#### Endgame

# Game as system
- interaction with system
- control
- feadback


```
Elusiveness  As Mardon and Belk note, 4 they offer things like:

Time aristocracy

Artificially limited availability
Location-based availability
Social-based availability

Authenticity
Letting virtual items develop a “digital patina”
Surfacing metadata about objects
Creating unique or special copies of items


- meta economy -


```




# Emergent systems

EMERGENCE - phenomena where Entirity of system egsibit properties thet parts of system dont have.
emerg arise from complexity   Whole is better than parts.   WORLD IS BUILD UPON TIS EMERGENCE

modeling techniques:
- calculation is linear > linera story  
- simulation paraler > paraller gameplay

 explicitly pre-determined vs emergent Systems.

systemic emergent: - wehen rules of system can be combbined in novel ouitcomes  
narrative emergence -  sequence of event .


emergent enable larger possibilities with simpler components

#### Structure dynamics:

Topologies (how elements are connetcted. relationship between objects. Linear, tree, network, )
- **Agents** - (very flexible, sims)
- **Network** - (longer time boundaries - sims online, or structures like city)
- **Layers** - (simcity). Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mind

Dynamics:  
- **Propagation**  - Flow: material(people cargo), indformation (comunication), pattern(compression of trafic). propagate throu space and time. Vector fields. Wave. (farther is less amplitude but longer wave) wwertical propagation. (like corporate delegation, if actor cannot resolve ask up node), propagation throu agents (bees & flowers)
- **Growth** - (in size or numbre, more links, network,) s-curve is natural. Faster growth until lack of resources
- **Group** - Cooperation driven by competition. Depend on econoies of scale, enabled by comunication and control, encourage specialization (when efficiency of group is better than beeing alone, breeds network (compiting interdependent balanced with cooperation)). Groups of similar items is clasification. Group soldiers if to many decision on lower level. / Attraction tend to create groups. Flocks, Gravity/ Group  have boundries (Go)
- **Order** -
- **Allocation** - Allocation of time, how to spend time. (game of prioritues)
- **Mapping** - Forming temporary networks, (tetris), fighting game (what weapon use against sth,..). State machinses have inside mapping. Map correct responce,  
- **Specialization** - Like town districts.  need enough components, strategic allocation of rsources,  
- **Nesting** -

Paradigms (ways topologies are maped on dynamics)
- **Natwork Theory** -
- **Adaptive system** - Complex systems like biological (watch not adaptive). Machine learning
- **Chaos Theroy** - Small change in initial condition will have vast change in system.
- **Cellura automata** - Highly emergent. Conway's Game of Life
- **System Dynamics** -

Competitions > growth > Grouping > specializsation > propagation > alocation > network > boundaries >nesting, level up (can start competition again on higher level)

##### Stock to Flow
Population - is stock  
Births rate - is flow

# GENERATIVE DESIGN

map:
- culture, impact of weather ...

pootential of generative stories depend on chow elements of mechanics are connected toghether


ecosystem:

### Structure

-  relationshiops

### Progression
progression ssytem
a-b mission Endgame [Ludology](/ludology/) / sandbox / vechicle /  

### Victory condition

# Econotmy and

- economy
- market


### Risk aversion problems:
###### Grind
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of increasing party level, stats
- czasowy jak w ogema

###### Farming
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of finding a rare item drop


###### Backward pedaling
doom 2016 forrowrd combad - build forroward momentum from glory kills  


### Bargaining


# Balance
difficulti   
- not only hp or strenght but also what u see on screen   




----


# Combat
non combat - combat loop

mele shooting   

Hitscan vs projectile


 ||||
 |--|--|--|
 |Projectiles|stayback|
 |Hitscan|charging|


## Encounters


##### Enemies
  types and classes .
  - short long distance and speed
  - difficulty

###### Waves

  - increase and manipulate amounts / strength



## Aiming And shooting
-----------

# Puzzles

- find clues with key parts
- puzle
-

Beacons - random dice rolles for multiplayer.  posted publicy over time for later verification + link to previous number (like posting time&date)


Achievements

---

---
game eg. with simple rules with costs. of building :
offence - 2
defence - 1
production - 5
maping decisions how to play (what build next).
- short / long term
- hi risk hi reward / lo risk
- order (productopn, missions, what to build first)
- Allocation suplay network
- Boudries
