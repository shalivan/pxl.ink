# Mechanics   




# Structure



[Game Design](/gamedesign/)   
[Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)   
[Game Theory](/gametheory/)   


Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.




#### Cycles (gameplay loop )

**Second to second**  -   micronarrative  (momentary)  core mechanics  
**Minute to minute**  -   events, tactics and problem-solving puzzles  
**Hour to Hour**  - (structural)  game premise goal. why where  

- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change

.
- life cycle of agents in simulation . Dynamicly changing agets  


#### Endgame

# Game as system
- interaction with system
- control
- feadback


```
Elusiveness  As Mardon and Belk note, 4 they offer things like:

Time aristocracy

Artificially limited availability
Location-based availability
Social-based availability

Authenticity
Letting virtual items develop a “digital patina”
Surfacing metadata about objects
Creating unique or special copies of items


- meta economy -


```




# Emergent systems

EMERGENCE - phenomena where Entirity of system egsibit properties thet parts of system dont have.
emerg arise from complexity   Whole is better than parts.   WORLD IS BUILD UPON TIS EMERGENCE

modeling techniques:
- calculation is linear > linera story  
- simulation paraler > paraller gameplay

 explicitly pre-determined vs emergent Systems.

systemic emergent: - wehen rules of system can be combbined in novel ouitcomes  
narrative emergence -  sequence of event .


emergent enable larger possibilities with simpler components

#### Structure dynamics:

Topologies (how elements are connetcted. relationship between objects. Linear, tree, network, )
- **Agents** - (very flexible, sims)
- **Network** - (longer time boundaries - sims online, or structures like city)
- **Layers** - (simcity). Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mind

Dynamics:  
- **Propagation**  - Flow: material(people cargo), indformation (comunication), pattern(compression of trafic). propagate throu space and time. Vector fields. Wave. (farther is less amplitude but longer wave) wwertical propagation. (like corporate delegation, if actor cannot resolve ask up node), propagation throu agents (bees & flowers)
- **Growth** - (in size or numbre, more links, network,) s-curve is natural. Faster growth until lack of resources
- **Group** - Cooperation driven by competition. Depend on econoies of scale, enabled by comunication and control, encourage specialization (when efficiency of group is better than beeing alone, breeds network (compiting interdependent balanced with cooperation)). Groups of similar items is clasification. Group soldiers if to many decision on lower level. / Attraction tend to create groups. Flocks, Gravity/ Group  have boundries (Go)
- **Order** -
- **Allocation** - Allocation of time, how to spend time. (game of prioritues)
- **Mapping** - Forming temporary networks, (tetris), fighting game (what weapon use against sth,..). State machinses have inside mapping. Map correct responce,  
- **Specialization** - Like town districts.  need enough components, strategic allocation of rsources,  
- **Nesting** -

Paradigms (ways topologies are maped on dynamics)
- **Natwork Theory** -
- **Adaptive system** - Complex systems like biological (watch not adaptive). Machine learning
- **Chaos Theroy** - Small change in initial condition will have vast change in system.
- **Cellura automata** - Highly emergent. Conway's Game of Life
- **System Dynamics** -

Competitions > growth > Grouping > specializsation > propagation > alocation > network > boundaries >nesting, level up (can start competition again on higher level)

##### Stock to Flow
Population - is stock  
Births rate - is flow

# GENERATIVE DESIGN

map:
- culture, impact of weather ...

pootential of generative stories depend on chow elements of mechanics are connected toghether


ecosystem:

### Structure

-  relationshiops

### Progression
progression ssytem
a-b mission Endgame [Ludology](/ludology/) / sandbox / vechicle /  

### Victory condition

# Economy and

- economy
- market


### Risk aversion problems:
###### Grind
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of increasing party level, stats
- czasowy jak w ogema

###### Farming
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of finding a rare item drop


###### Backward pedaling
doom 2016 forrowrd combad - build forroward momentum from glory kills  


### Bargaining


# Balance
Aperance of balance in experience. Math + sys + psychology
methods:
- designre intuition and experience
- playtesting (and changes on exploits)
- analytyc (data from game and drawing tdstitical conclusion )
- mat modeling (model and choose proper One)

trade danger for time for advancemetn ... and more

[YT GDC 2018 Power Curve ](https://youtu.be/ul1MSQ8aW00)
### Numeric relationship Between Resources
linear and identity
triangular  and polinomial
exp and log
chains of relationships

#### Economic system
#### Creating/deriving a cost Curve
balance on skill
Balance between  benefit and cost
#### Probability
balance on chance
**Dieces**
**Cards**
##### Probability  Fallacies and failures
human intuition get probability wrong

##### Situational balance
##### Probability recursion
`monte carlo` + avarage    
`markov chains`   - A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. ..

##### Mertics

##### Statistical analysis
how to calculate when have probability
... you are threat it as probability

statistics is revert probability  

mean, mediana
standard deviation
z test
statistic significance



#### Progression & Rewars Curves
also by probability with advancement in progression and pacing

leveling curves  

etics !
