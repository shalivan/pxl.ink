# Emergent systems

EMERGENCE - phenomena where Entirity of system egsibit properties thet parts of system dont have.
emerg arise from complexity   Whole is better than parts.   WORLD IS BUILD UPON TIS EMERGENCE

systemic emergent: - wehen rules of system can be combbined in novel ouitcomes  
narrative emergence -  sequence of event .


Structure dynamics:

Topologies (how elements are connetcted. relationship between objects. Linear, tree, network, )
- **Agents** (very flexible, sims)
- **Network** (longer time boundaries - sims online, or structures like city)
- **Layers** (simcity)

Dynamics:  
- **Propagation**  - flow: material(people cargo), indformation (comunication), pattern(compression of trafic). propagate throu space and time. Vector fields. Wave. (farther is less amplitude but longer wave) wwertical propagation. (like corporate delegation, if actor cannot resolve ask up node), propagation throu agents (bees & flowers)
- **Growth** (in size or numbre, more links, network,) s-curve is natural. Faster growth until lack of resources
- **Group** - cooperation driven by competition. Depend on econoies of scale, enabled by comunication and control, encourage specialization (when efficiency of group is better than beeing alone, breeds network (compiting interdependent balanced with cooperation)). Groups of similar items is clasification. Group soldiers if to many decision on lower level. / Attraction tend to create groups. Flocks, Gravity/ Group  have boundries (Go)
- **Order**
- **Allocation** - allocation of time, how to spend time. (game of prioritues)
- **Mapping** - forming temporary networks, (tetris), fighting game (what weapon use against sth,..). State machinses have inside mapping. Map correct responce,  
- **Specialization** -like town districts.  need enough components, strategic allocation of rsources,  
- **Nesting**

Paradigms (ways topologies are maped on dynamics)
- **Natwork Theory**
- **Adaptive system**
- **Chaos Theroy**
- **Cellura automata**
- **System Dynamics**

#### EMERGENT NARRATIVE
own story (with autor rules) not direct writer expression : DWARF FORTRESS
need building blocks :
- resonant theme - as universal as practial if desired for sharing
- meshes narratively with existing mechanics - test against sample story or patch existinh holes
- mechanics <support> presentation
- inveolves user in state

give you

rouglike games , minecrafts, sandboxes

enable make own story with tools we get


# GENERATIVE DESIGN

map:
- culture, impact of weather ...

pootential of generative stories depend on chow elements of mechanics are connected toghether


ecosystem:

### Structure

-  relationshiops

### Progression
progression ssytem
a-b mission Endgame [Ludology](/ludology/) / sandbox / vechicle /  

### Victory condition

# Econotmy and

- economy
- market


### Risk aversion problems:
###### Grind
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of increasing party level, stats
- czasowy jak w ogema

###### Farming
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of finding a rare item drop


###### Backward pedaling
doom 2016 forrowrd combad - build forroward momentum from glory kills  


### Bargaining


# Balance
difficulti   
- not only hp or strenght but also what u see on screen   




----


# Combat
non combat - combat loop
## Encounters


##### Enemies
  types and classes .
  - short long distance and speed
  - difficulty

###### Waves

  - increase and manipulate amounts / strength



  bullet points

-----------

 explicitly pre-determined vs emergent Systems.

---

emergent enable larger possibilities with simpler components

- life cycle of agents in simulation . Dynamicly changing agets  

..

modeling techniques:
- calculation is linear > linera story  
- simulation paraler > paraller gameplay

```
# Game as system
- meta economy -

- interaction with system
- control
- feadback

Elusiveness  As Mardon and Belk note, 4 they offer things like:

Time aristocracy

Artificially limited availability
Location-based availability
Social-based availability

Authenticity
Letting virtual items develop a “digital patina”
Surfacing metadata about objects
Creating unique or special copies of items
```

# Puzzles

- find clues with key parts
- puzle
-

Beacons - random dice rolles for multiplayer.  posted publicy over time for later verification + link to previous number (like posting time&date)
