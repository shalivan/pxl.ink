[Level Design](/leveldesign/)  


Mechanics a Design
- enable narrative throu systems
- use mechanics as metaphore
how rules incentivise to act stories.
justification of gamepplay mechanics writen in to the lore


# Structure

[Ludology](/ludology/)

[Game Design](/gamedesign/)   
[Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)   
[Game Theory](/gametheory/)   


Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.




## Game as system
- interaction with system
- control
- feedback




## Emergent systems
Emergence - phenomena where Entirety of system exhibit properties that parts of system don't have.
emerge arise from complexity. World is build upon its emergence. Enable larger possibilities with simpler components


modeling techniques:
- **Explicitly pre-determined** - calculation is linear > linear story  
- **Emergent Systems** - simulation parallel > parallel gameplay
  - Systemic emergent - when rules of system can be combined in novel outcomes  
  - Narrative emergence -  sequence of event .

#### Structure dynamics:

||Topologies (how elements are connected. relationship between objects. Linear, tree, network, )|
|-|-|
**Agents** | (very flexible, sims)
**Network** | (longer time boundaries - sims online, or structures like city)
**Layers** | (SimCity). Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mind

||Dynamics|
|-|-|
**Propagation** | Flow: material(people cargo), information (communication), pattern(compression of traffic). propagate through space and time. Vector fields. Wave. (farther is less amplitude but longer wave) vertical propagation. (like corporate delegation, if actor cannot resolve ask up node), propagation through agents (bees & flowers)
**Growth** | (in size or number, more links, network,) s-curve is natural. Faster growth until lack of resources
**Group** | Cooperation driven by competition. Depend on economies of scale, enabled by communication and control, encourage specialization (when efficiency of group is better than being alone, breeds network (competing interdependent balanced with cooperation)). Groups of similar items is classification. Group soldiers if to many decision on lower level. / Attraction tend to create groups. Flocks, Gravity/ Group  have boundaries (Go)
**Order** |
**Allocation** | Allocation of time, how to spend time. (game of priorities)
**Mapping** | Forming temporary networks, (Tetris), fighting game (what weapon use against sth,..). State machines have inside mapping. Map correct response,  
**Specialization** | Like town districts.  need enough components, strategic allocation of resources,  
**Nesting** |

||Paradigms (ways topologies are mapped on dynamics)|
|-|-|
**Network Theory** |
**Adaptive system** | Complex systems like biological (watch not adaptive). Machine learning
**Chaos Theory** | Small change in initial condition will have vast change in system.
**Cellular automata** | Highly emergent. Conway's Game of Life
**System Dynamics** |

Competitions > growth > Grouping > specialization > propagation > allocation > network > boundaries >nesting, level up (can start competition again on higher level)

## Generative systems

pootential of generative stories depend on chow elements of mechanics are connected together

// ? if you generating ther whole story your mechanics must include loss and recovery
map:


repeated constens (non procedural) is where you cannot do otherwise


### Structure

- relationships
- ecosystem

```
Agents (flex)
Network - social
Layers (rigid)
```



## Risk aversion problems:
###### Grind
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of increasing party level, stats
- czasowy jak w ogema
###### Farming
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of finding a rare item drop
###### Backward pedaling
doom 2016 forrowrd combad - build forroward momentum from glory kills  
###### Camping
like in gears




# Puzzles


A food puzzle
- Tells you how to solve it, inherent in its design
- Doesn't relay on outside knowledge
- is also adjustable in difficult by adding or reducing information

types:
- find clues with key parts
- puzzle



----
Beacons - random dice rolles for multiplayer.  posted publicy over time for later verification + link to previous number (like posting time&date)


Achievements

---
game eg. with simple rules with costs. of building :
offence - 2
defence - 1
production - 5
maping decisions how to play (what build next).
- short / long term
- hi risk hi reward / lo risk
- order (productopn, missions, what to build first)
- Allocation suplay network
- Boudries




# Progres
also by probability with advancement in progression and pacing

leveling curves  

etics !

#### Feedback loops (output pushed to input)
- positive: ... increase ains to more gains , loses to more loses  (loose chest figure mean u weeker)
- negative - balance out failures and posit. - Mario carts, those at back get powerfull weapons.  winners punished and loosers are rewarded (keep changes in equilibruim)
-
- positive,  - help push to conclusion for party game where everyone is equal - frustrating for weeker players  (snowball problem)
- negative  - unfair to succesful players. - can send mixed signals

Pyre - mix
rpgs - more u level up, more time takes to level up again


Good feedback techniques ! !!!! importanat part







# Economy

- economy
- market
supply and demand
zelda : chemistry engine  

- fuel, raw materials

#### Stock to Flow
Population - is stock  
Births rate - is flow

#### Economic system
Economies

#### Ecosystems
Ecologies - balance not reinforce each other . balance in dynamic universe.

# Enemies
  types and classes .
  - short long distance and speed
  - difficulty

## Encounters
Events with NPCs

###### Waves
Increase and manipulate amounts / strength

- combat types
- obrona manewrowa
- raidy

# Combat
non combat - combat loop
fighhting games are rock paper scisors (advanced with reading opponents pre anims to read next move )   

## Combat loop
pasing / important elements
- doom dropp all what slow down actions (like aming)
peak priorities
how much weapons / how get new and ammo ...
upgread trees
pase - of new tools and mechanics  2.


## AI

[YT rainworld 2d ai](https://youtu.be/hOsYTzd0yeA) -

### .
- pathfinding
- behaviur trees - selector node / sequence node (queque)


## Mele

### Timed
not instant. 3 phases
1. anticipation - speed  
2. contact
3. recovery

tacticly distinct !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - could be subtle -
Advantages / Disadvantage - (heavy damage slow)

- fast /slow  -  light 14 frames - heavy 28 frames and u are vonurable beform hit
- wide/ range
- push away/ knock down /air
- work on distance
- stunt  - watch for stunt lock (get enemy in loop )
- culdown to not spawning
- player vornuable after use
- required sth
- animation canceling. (no in darksouls)  carfeul and commiting
- range distance/snaping  (depend how sticky ) in batman lot of snaping (and in other flow quick )- not in dark souls
- distnace - tip of blade more crit than full close.
- charge

combos and controls.
- seq of keys or gesture
- chain of same keys in rythm

parry / counter - block exackly when u block in same time of attack  .
  - efortless vs
  - only in slmall time slot - can damage if not done in time


tactic:
- piking targts - kill the hiller


## Shooting  
Recoil    
Hitscan vs projectile   

 ||||
 |--|--|--|
 |Projectiles|stayback|
 |Hitscan|charging|

Projectiles are predictible

#### guns
how many ... reload

fast asoult rifle   
shotgun at close   
rocket lounch deadly but risky   

### Aiming

auto aim   

https://twitter.com/Fading_Shadow_/status/1540095904643895296
- The Accuracy Cone (= Error Angle) defines an area where your bullet can land. The placement of your bullet within this area is entirely random.
- The Aim Assist Cone defines an area around your reticle where the game will look for enemy targets. Once an enemy enters this area (or you move your reticle close to them) Aim Assist will kick in. What Aim Assist does is it snaps your accuracy cone to a target. [cont]...] What's important about this is that the Aim Assist is factored in first which means that the randomness introduced by the Accuracy Cone will not be corrected for by Aim Assist.
So TLDR: Accuracy doesn't care what's in front of you, it's purely RNG

First on that list is the in-air accuracy penalty. ⏬
Fading Shadow

Each archetype of weapon has an intrinsic penalty to accuracy that is activated as soon as your boots leave the ground.
This penalty cuts the remaining cone you have in half again leaving you with 1/4 of the original size of your Aim Assist cone.



# Balance

Appearance of balance in experience. Math + systems + psychology   
Methods:
- Designers intuition and experience
- Playtesting (and changes on exploits)
- Analytic (data from game and drawing statical conclusion )
- Math modeling (model and choose proper One)


trade danger for time for advancemetn ... and more
- Economy - balanced
- Ecology - emergent

## .

### Creating/deriving a cost Curve
Balance on skill  
Balance between  benefit and cost   
Can reward certain playstyles  

###  Grim Dice
Deices that beat each other in circle - highest number win

### Numeric relationship Between Resources
linear and identity
triangular  and polynomial
exp and log
chains of relationships


#### Probability
balance on chance
**Dices**
**Cards**

Gamble
beating mechanics.  

##### Probability  Fallacies and failures
human intuition get probability wrong


##### Situational balance

##### Probability recursion
`monte carlo` + avarage    
`markov chains`   - A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. ..

https://datagenetics.com/blog.html !!!!,


##### Mertics

Prevent yourself from opinions, and look how they releated to team finish goal.
Outline golas and define cucces. Separate facts  (metrics) form opinions and use fact for understanding (analytic).  and guide decision makeing.
What you are bulding / Why / Who for << this define goals.

|Metrics|Analytics|
|---|---|
Mathematics | Social science
Tangible | Intangible
Past | Future
Information | Transformation
Gathering | Asking questions
Reporting | Analyzing


##### Statistical analysis
how to calculate when have probability
... you are threat it as probability

statistics is revert probability  

mean, mediana
standard deviation
z test
statistic significance



#### Progression & Reward Curves
also by probability with advancement in progression and pacing

leveling curves  

etics !

#### Intransitive mechanics. game theory
Payoff matrices

transitivity-in-game-theory
https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2019/10/the-math-of-games-what-is-transitivity-in-game-theory.html

difficulty   
- not only HP or strength but also what u see on screen   


https://datagenetics.com/blog.html


#### statistics
- avarage can be different when sample is small, and sensitive to outliers  
- p - chance of being wrong `false positive`
- mediana - half
- corelation and association is not causation: direction of causality may be unclear ot there may be a hidden confounding variable.

t-test -
mann-whitney test -
