# Game Theory
mathematical study of optimizing agents strategies in games where outcome depend on other agents actions.
- `Cooperative` - how to be fair - coalition and benefit and contribution type in coalition
- `Competitive` - how to be smart


- `Zero Sum Game` - Interest is not overlapping. `win-lose`
- `imperfect information games` - depth limited search.

**Nash equilibrium**
(rational play when more then one player. not only define start but always believes)
Is a concept within game theory where the optimal outcome of a game is where no player have incentives to deviate from initial strategy.

**Poisoner dilemma**
Very complicated not always everything plays around these lines. (some Exceptions)   
multiple goals, number of rounds....  In lot of species there is no cognitive strategy  


**two player vs more**


# Strategies

**Tic Tac Toe**  

##### Pavlov strategy
 - switch if not working (you can exploit)  
#### TfT
-  `Tit for tat` drove other strategies to extinction and formalize optimal strategy  may lose battles but win wars. (Vulnerable of signal error). Start nice cooperating > forgiving > cooperate when you can   
#### FTfT
- `forgiving tit for tat`  witch is more vulnerable for exploitation TfT -> jezeli zaufanie to switch to forgiven TFTF Trust  
#### Madness
- possibility of changes   
Strategies to survive forgiving tic for tat (vulnerable to exploit) > forgiven tic for tat after while  


#### Game Theory Optimal
- assumes opponent is always countering with the perfect strategy
- can have lower yield EV then exploitative play

pkr > fint highest EV lines routes possible for have best formulatetd strategy. + balance it to dont be exploited.
but can be not profitable as exploit.  
balance stratedy  

##### Exploitative
-humans make a lot errors  exploit mistakes
