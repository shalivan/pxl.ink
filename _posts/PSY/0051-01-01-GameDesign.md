- distance from pivor
- laterral and vertical offset for framing
- fov

(user think in euler look up down or on sides)

####  FPS
simple


####  TPS fixed:
2d scroller   
camera locked  (rails)    
top wiev: rts-top   
slajdy   

####  TPS dynamic:
thgird person - hardest to design  (fixed angels are easier to make)
- automatic gudience to not controll cam and character by player
   - cam and level work toghether
   - line of sight must be small enough to fit throuhgh level
   - swing away from obstacles (detected earlier)
   - camera must satisfy lot of constraints
   - you can change distance to player depend on angle
   - see player and enviroment
   - depth perception and distance judgeing is preaty week
