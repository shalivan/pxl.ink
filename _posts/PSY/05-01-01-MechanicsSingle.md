crafting !!! 
- collecting < exploring need to be 
- lab -
	- skill base controll 
- purpose of things 
	- -

CASINO 

- oportunity  - get sth of valu
- unpredictable rewards - you have no ida when 
- quick repetibility - 


variable reinfocement loop 
- near misses 
- losses disguises wins - whenn you win  less than you put but it can be stil thought as a win. 

--------

Randomnes 

Types:
input - good pre random - fair, more strategic game, 
 post random output randomness - less 

limit randomnes to get exxpected effect more offten. 

Casino. 


--------

mechanics - how game works 
dynamics - how player acts 
asthetics - how player feels


thrill of unknow 
struggle to survive 
can be also **feeling** > relax (flowe)
**experience** - comanding a strship 
character 

# Structure

Mechanics should be **part of narration** - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience. Justification of gameplay mechanics written in to the lore
- Enable narrative through systems
- Use mechanics as metaphor
how rules incentivize to act stories.


# Systems

### Game as system
- Interaction with system
- Control
- Feedback


## Random Encounters

**Beacons** - random dice rolls for multiplayer.  posted publicly over time for later verification + link to previous number (like posting time & date)

## Emergent systems
Emergence - phenomena where Entirety of system exhibit properties that parts of system don't have.
emerge arise from complexity. World is build upon its emergence. Enable larger possibilities with simpler components

Modeling techniques:
- **Explicitly pre-determined** - calculation is linear > linear story  
- **Emergent Systems** - simulation parallel > parallel gameplay
  - Systemic emergent - when rules of system can be combined in novel outcomes  
  - Narrative emergence -  sequence of event .

#### Structure dynamics:

| |Topologies (how elements are connected. relationship between objects. Linear, tree, network, )|
|-|-|
|**Agents** | (very flexible, sims)
|**Network** | (longer time boundaries - sims online, or structures like city)
|**Layers** | (SimCity). Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mind
Overall, the concept of a social network with flexible agents and rigid layers offers a dynamic environment where structure allows for focused interaction, but individuals still have the freedom to adapt and explore.

Complex systems, specifically focusing on networks and group dynamics:

|                    | Dynamics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Propagation**    | Flow: material(people cargo), information (communication), pattern(compression of traffic). propagate through space and time. Vector fields. Wave. (farther is less amplitude but longer wave) vertical propagation. (like corporate delegation, if actor cannot resolve ask up node), propagation through agents (bees & flowers)                                                                                                         |
| **Growth**         | (in size or number, more links, network,) s-curve is natural. Faster growth until lack of resources                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Group**          | Cooperation driven by competition. Depend on economies of scale, enabled by communication and control, encourage specialization (when efficiency of group is better than being alone, breeds network (competing interdependent balanced with cooperation)). Groups of similar items is classification. Group soldiers if to many decision on lower level. / Attraction tend to create groups. Flocks, Gravity/ Group  have boundaries (Go) |
| **Order**          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Allocation**     | Allocation of time, how to spend time. (game of priorities)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Mapping**        | Forming temporary networks, (Tetris), fighting game (what weapon use against sth,..). State machines have inside mapping. Map correct response,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Specialization** | Like town districts.  need enough components, strategic allocation of resources,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Nesting**        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Ways topologies are mapped on dynamics:

|                       | Paradigms (ways topologies are mapped on dynamics)                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Theory**    |                                                                        |
| **Adaptive system**   | Complex systems like biological (watch not adaptive). Machine learning |
| **Chaos Theory**      | Small change in initial condition will have vast change in system.     |
| **Cellular automata** | Highly emergent. Conway's Game of Life                                 |
| **System Dynamics**   |                                                                        |

Competitions > growth > Grouping > specialization > propagation > allocation > network > boundaries >nesting, level up (can start competition again on higher level)

## Generative systems

Potential of generative stories depend on how elements of mechanics are connected together
If you generating the whole story your mechanics must include loss and recovery
- repeated consents (non procedural) is where you cannot do otherwise

### Structure

- Relationships
- Ecosystem


# Progres
... also by probability with advancement in progression and pacing

how to reflect growht in mechanics 




## Feedback loops (output pushed to input)

Good feedback techniques ! !!!! important part
- Positive: ... increase ains to more gains , loses to more loses  (loose chest figure mean u weeker)
- Negative - balance out failures and posit. - Mario carts, those at back get powerful weapons.  winners punished and losers are rewarded (keep changes in equilibrium)
-
- Positive,  - help push to conclusion for party game where everyone is equal - frustrating for weaker players  (snowball problem)
- Negative  - unfair to successful players. - can send mixed signals

Pyre - mix

## Achievements


## Leveling 
leveling curves  - rpgs - more u level up, more time takes to level up again





## Risk aversion problems:

#### Grind
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of increasing party level, stats
- czasowy jak w Ogame

#### Farming
Repeated battles for the sole purpose of finding a rare item drop

#### Backward pedaling
doom 2016 forward combat - build forward momentum from glory kills  

#### Camping
Like in gears



# Puzzles

A food puzzle
- Tells you how to solve it, inherent in its design
- Doesn't relay on outside knowledge
- is also adjustable in difficult by adding or reducing information

types:
- find clues with key parts
- puzzle

game eg. with simple rules with costs. of building :
offence - 2
defence - 1
production - 5
maping decisions how to play (what build next).
- short / long term
- hi risk hi reward / lo risk
- order (productopn, missions, what to build first)
- Allocation suplay network
- Boudries




# Balance

Math + syste, + psychology 
[gamebalanceconcepts.wordpress.com/](https://gamebalanceconcepts.wordpress.com/) + [GDC Video](https://youtu.be/tR-9oXiytsk)


Appearance of balance in experience. Math + systems + psychology   
Methods:
- Designers intuition and experience
- Playtesting (and changes on exploits)
- Analytic (data from game and drawing statical conclusion )
- Math modeling (model and choose proper One)


trade danger for time for advancemetn ... and more
- Economy - balanced
- Ecology - emergent

## .

### Creating/deriving a cost Curve
Balance on skill  
Balance between  benefit and cost   
Can reward certain playstyles  

### Grim Dice
Deices that beat each other in circle - highest number win

### Numeric relationship Between Resources
linear and identity
triangular  and polynomial
exp and log
chains of relationships


#### Probability
balance on chance
**Dices**
**Cards**

Gamble
Beating mechanics.  

##### Probability  Fallacies and failures
human intuition get probability wrong


##### Situational balance

##### Probability recursion
`monte carlo` + avarage    
`markov chains`   - A Markov chain or Markov process is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. ..

##### Metrics

Prevent yourself from opinions, and look how they related to team final goal.
Outline golas and define succes. Separate facts  (**metrics**) form opinions and use fact for understanding (**analytic**).  and guide decision making.
What you are budling / Why / Who for << this define goals.

| Metrics     | Analytics        |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Mathematics | Social science   |
| Tangible    | Intangible       |
| Past        | Future           |
| Information | Transformation   |
| Gathering   | Asking questions |
| Reporting   | Analyzing        |


##### Statistical analysis
how to calculate when have probability
... you are threat it as probability

statistics is revert probability  

mean, mediana
standard deviation
z test
statistic significance

#### Progression & Reward Curves
also by probability with advancement in progression and pacing

leveling curves  

etics !

#### Intransitive mechanics. game theory
Payoff matrices

https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2019/10/the-math-of-games-what-is-transitivity-in-game-theory.html

difficulty   
- not only HP or strength but also what u see on screen   


https://datagenetics.com/blog.html


#### statistics
- avarage can be different when sample is small, and sensitive to outliers  
- p - chance of being wrong `false positive`
- mediana - half
- corelation and association is not causation: direction of causality may be unclear ot there may be a hidden confounding variable.

t-test -
mann-whitney test -
