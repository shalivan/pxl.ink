### Classical Approach

- Jean Piaget (9 August 1896 â€“ 16 September 1980) was a Swiss psychologist Importance of games:
- Johan Huizinga: Nature & Significance of Play as a Cultural Phenomenon [pdf](https://nideffer.net/classes/270-08/week_01_intro/Huizinga.pdf)

# Ludology

**Ludology** (etymologically 'game logic') - Study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a field of cultural studies that deals with all types of games throughout history.

Every medium has its own narration styles, varying on genres and format. Linear narrative is not enough for games and can be less important. Movies can create 'knowledge differences' easier than games which blend protagonist and player.  Plot and characters are things VG find verry difficult to deal .

|Paradigm Characteristics |  [Narratology](/narratology/) |Ludology
|---|---|---|
Community structures | Mostly pedagogy, limited number of non-pedagogy researchers | Non-pedagogical game studies, although some thematic overlap with pedagogy
Group commitment networks |Wide range of disciplines, including drama & literature, education, cognition, management | Narrow range of allegiances, limited to non-pedagogy - one central research center, one peer-reviewed journal, and between one and two dozen primary investigators
Shared examples | Computer simulation, non computer simulation, role play, experiential learning, drama, literature, film | Videogame, virtual reality, hypertext, television, and emergent forms of computer play
Tacit knowledge and intuition | Pedagogical side of experience - i.e., learning and cognition | Non-pedagogical side of experience - i.e., play
| | Cyclical nature | Linear Nature


| Incommensurability | Inconclusive - depends on investigator's stance regarding reductionism and holistic thinking

See or listen not as powerful as play themselves:
- Games as `Rules` + `fictional Content`
- Free movement and actions, Need to act.` Engage with external`
- `Reactivity` Respond to your actions






# Authorship
**Narrative** (story meaning) vs **Mechanics** (dynamical meaning). Driven How much power over the world.
`Linear` > `Interactive Linear` >  `Multi ending` >  `Branching path` (multi choice but not emergent) > `Open ended` > `Emergent` >  `Fully player driven` (cyclical) > `Random`

**Game story domination**  -   Authored - no impact on story - Linear  - low agency hi certainty of deliver    
**Player story domination** -  Generative - agency & expression of will - Cyclical  - high agency, low certainty


- Film: Pre, Pro, Post  (Alex McDowell - world building)
- Arch: Pre Design, Schematic, Design, Construction
- In changing env: Observe > Orient > Decide(feedback) > Act (feedback) () OODA Loop )
- General design process: Empathize > Define > Ideate > Prototype > test


## Agency / Autonomy
the abstract principle that autonomous beings, agents, are capable of acting by themselves; see autonomy  
From a game design perspective, Player Agency is the player's ability to impact the story through the game design or gameplay1

create problem not puzzle

1. Quality
 - `Active presence` - expressing agency and will taking actions and locomotive. Extorting will into expression - video games
 - `Mental & Social` -  communicationg with abstraction of language -literature, podcasting, consuming information, internet
 - `Embodied & Environmental` - cinematic storyteling of film, music lighting rythm (fiulm, build and release narrative tension) give sense of time  - music
 - `Emotional` - site touch smell, haptics. we are trying to digitalize those inputs - theather architecture (VR)
2. Context
3. Character
4. Story

Outward Inward / Individual Bonding

# Narration
Some game structures can be metaphors
## Explicit
**Text written narrator**. explicit things are explained.  (cutscenes). In literature: An explicit narrator is a narrator or character in a story that is the one telling the story. First person narrators are by definition explicit narrators.

### Narrator
- silent protagonist - to feel easy to slip in his role . (silence and concient is like agree)
add to agency

## Implicit
Implied - Suggested but not directly expressed. Arises **from visual cues** that create the barest impression of a story in the minds of viewers. It is the act of withholding the whole story, rather than the attempt to visually illustrate the story, that defines these images. player must figure out itself


###  Environmental

[Level Design](/leveldesign/)  
Narrative spaces   
most immersive  - it s the world speak and player will find their own story  



## Emergent
Emergent - make own story  with tools we get (author rules), but not direct writer expression      
Mechanics in narration - implement plot in mechanics  

### Emerge from systems

Need building blocks    
- resonant theme - as universal as practical if desired for sharing
- meshes narratively with existing mechanics - test against sample story or patch existing holes
- mechanics <support> presentation
- involves user in state

(Roguelikes, Sandboxes, Minecraft's, Dwarf Fortress)





### Procedural storytelling
Procedural Narrative Generation:

Prioritizes agent spontniety (all imporvisation and simulation ) (Dwarf Fortress) <> Priotitize authorial structure (Adventures )
- simulation crntric approach  
- plot centric approach

## Random?

#### Randomness
- (pre luck) input (before player make decision): levels
- (post luck) output  (after action, hit chances in x com, lutbox) (more anger and res not for competence but bad luck undercuts strategy )

#### Experience as an end itself

# Experience


Alfred North Whitehead (known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as process philosophy) reality is experience.   



## Psych states

###  Presence  
`Teleport body`   


### Immerse  
`Teleport mind` - deep mental involvement. Immerse : altered time, with general sense of space (spatial)
Fully `immersed` with mechanics while `challenge` and `tension` in balance  (`anxiety` vs `boredom`)



### Engagement  
Manual or mental `effort meets interactivity` (involves solving problems) (not in books)   
Psychological presence. According to his definition, engagement refers to the state in which individuals express their entire self

##  Illusion

People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

### Virtual vs real experience

- people are able to belief in fake
- real world experience have additional fidelity



### Suspension of Disbelief
- accepting unrealistic situations
- audience scram on movies
- Rules of game established reality that become a game norm
- Suspension of disbelief is necessary only when we failed to create secondary belief.
- inconsistence can break immersion


### Paradox of control
key element of enjoyment
how to offer meaningful choice  without offering full control.


### Illusion
Only when authentic (coherent and consistent )

Belief - Fiction is not real    
Alife - Suspend true believe for a moment   

we know how feelings are - experience taking. match own emotions with fictional characters. experience taking is harder in front of mirror so it can be related with ego suppress.

###  Flow  
`Flow` state / the `Zone`
`Game Follow` - is wave zone between anxiety and boredom (sometimes challenge and sometimes powerful)  
- `Difficulty Curve` - Challenge  
- `Pacing` Rhythm + Pressure >Manage stress. If there is no stress its not meaningful and you don't care. So pressure is good  
- `Learning Curve` - Onboarding > tutorials super important   


Challenges vs Abilities


|Challenges/Abilities |Low  || High  |
|--|--|--|--|
High |Anxiety (stressed, Alert) | Arousal (Alert Focused) | Flow (Focused, Happy)
 | | Worry (Sad, Stressed) || Control (Happy, Confident)
Low | Apathy (Sad, Depressed) |Boredom (Depressed, Contented)|Relaxation (Confident, Contented)





- primal forces
- context depended
- expose things to promote them
- predictable

if you lost a momentum from one moment to next and persist in that state


involvement, commitment, passion,
enthusiasm, absorption, focused effort, zeal, dedication, and energy.



### Emotions
Revarding or Aversive

|Primal Emtion|Affective Feeling|
|--|--|
Seeking | Enthousiastic
Rage | Pissed-off
Fear | Anxious
Lust | Horny
Care | Tender & Loving
Panic | Lonley & Sad
Play | Joyous





### Entertainment
- Entertainment is an escape from problems

things happening > its excitement its entertainment

# Ludo narrative

Harmony & Disonance
- Action fit settings to achieve harmony relation between narration and gameplay
premise and setting of story make sense with actions you perform
- It only appear when player can interact with world in meaningful for a story way. feel game through the gameplay
how themes are communicated through the gameplay


[YT - Meaningful Mechanics](https://youtu.be/KkdPxZbUNSw)  
mechanics follow narration :
restricted movement - is narration
cyclical naure  


**Connect controls/mechnic with feelings**







[Motivation](/motivation/)



# MDA framework
Game designers will establish the rules and boundaries of a game (`Mechanics`) to create a certain sort of playing environment (`Dynamics`) which will invoke certain feelings, such as fun or thrill, in the player (`Aesthetics`).

|Mechanics|Dynamics|Aesthetic|
|--|--|--|
|Strategic | Systemic | Narrative
|Rules | System | Fun

Resonate !
Bonding vs	Bridging



Fun enable easy learning   



Exposition is ok in games sometimes  - (moving story forward plot device - shity - dressed up exposition )
- `Repetition` to highlight importance !  -
- `Dissonant Juxtaposition `- przeciwstawne rzeczy naprzeciw siebie (things side buy side creat context between them 0 if context is contradictory create mental dissonance audience need to resolve)




## Ending:
- force to reflect
- reconsider theme we starting with.

contiguous	structural

Broadly defined, spatial activities are activities that involve reasoning about qualities of space (e.g., distance, proportion), practicing mental visualization (e.g., imagining spatial layouts or spatial trajectories), and observing the positions of physical objects.
