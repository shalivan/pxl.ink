**Ludology** (etymologically 'game logic'), is the study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a field of cultural studies that deals with all types of games throughout history.


Every medium have it own narrations styles, varying on genres and format. Linear narrative is not enough for games.
movie can create knowledge difference easy . game blend protagonist and player.  


|Paradigm Characteristics |  [Narratology](/narratology/) |Ludology
|---|---|---|
Community structures | Mostly pedagogy, limited number of non-pedagogy researchers | Non-pedagogical game studies, although some thematic overlap with pedagogy
Group commitment networks |Wide range of disciplines, including drama & literature, education, cognition, management | Narrow range of allegiances, limited to non-pedagogy - one central research center, one peer-reviewed journal, and between one and two dozen primary investigators
Shared examples | Computer simulation, noncomputer simulation, role play, experiential learning, drama, literature, film | Videogame, virtual reality, hypertext, television, and emergent forms of computer play
Tacit knowledge and intuition | Pedagogical side of experience - i.e., learning and cognition | Non-pedagogical side of experience - i.e., play

| Incommensurability | Inconclusive - depends on investigator's stance regarding reductionism and holistic thinking

Games and stories share a lot in common but Narratology in games can be not as important.

- Games as Rules + fictional Content
- Free movement and actions   
- See or listen not as powerful as play themselves
- Need to act. Engage with external   

Cyclical structure,


exposition is ok in games sometimes

# Narration

- game premise goal. why where
- events  
- micronarrative

```
Horror can easly do away with character and plot. tension, shock, monsters.  
Plot and characters are things VG find verry difficult to deal .
```

### Authorship
Narrative vs Mechanics. Driven How much power over the world.  
Traditionsl > Interactive Traditional >  multi ending >  branching path > open ended > fully player driven.

**Game story domination**  -   Authored - no impact on story - Linear
**Player story domination** -  Generative - agency & expression of will - cyclical


- Film: Pre, Pro, Post  (Alex McDowell - world building)
- Arch: Pre Design, Schematic, Design, Construction
- In changing env: Observe > Orient > Decide(feedback) > Act (feedback) () OODA Loop )
- General design process: Empathize > Define > Ideate > Prototype > test


mechanick video storytell:
- Edit finth, fish gameplay
- Half Life2, can to trash tutorial




### Ludo narrative Harmony
- Action fit settings to achieve harmony relation between narration and gameplay
premise and setting of story make sense with actions you perform
- It only appear when player can interact with world in meaningful for a story way. feel game through the gameplay
how themes are communicated through the gameplay


https://youtu.be/KkdPxZbUNSw
mechanics follow narration :
restricted movement - is narration
cyclical naure  


#### Connect controls with feelings

#### NARRATIVE WITH BRANCHES
multi choice but not emergent

## Explicit
Cutscenes text written narrator    





In literature: An explicit narrator is a narrator or character in a story that is the one telling the story. First person narrators are by definition explicit narrators.


##  Implied
Implicit

An implied narrative arises from visual cues that create the barest impression of a story in the minds of viewers. It is the act of withholding the whole story, rather than the attempt to visually illustrate the story, that defines these images

player must figure out itself   
implicit refers to something that is suggested or implied but not ever clearly said.

a reliable character telling their own story, a character telling another character's story, and an unreliable character telling the story.

Mistrust and misdirection  often are good narrative tools    

##  Emergent
Emerge from system     
Mechanics in narration - implement plot in mechanics  

### Random

randomness
- (pre luck) input (before player make decision): levels
- (post luck) output  (after action, hit chances in x com, lutbox) (more anger and res not for competence but bad luck undercuts strategy )



### Procedural storytelling

##  Environmental

[Level Design](/leveldesign/)  

most immersive
it s the world speak and player will find their own story

###### Narrator

silent protagonist - to feel easy to slip in his role . (silence and concient is like agree)
add to agency

---


# Experience
Experience as an end itself

Alfred North Whitehead (known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as process philosophy) reality is experience.  


#### Virtual vs real experience

real world experience have additional fidelity  

## Psychology


##### Suspension of Disbelief
- accepting unrealistic situations
- audience scram on movies
- Rules of game established reality that become a game norm
- Suspension of disbelief is necessary only when we failed to create secondary belief.
- inconsistence can break immersion


### Paradox of control
key element of enjoyment
how to offer meaningful choice  without offering full control.


##### Illusion
Only when authentic (coherent and consistent )

Belief - Fiction is not real    
Alife - Suspend true believe for a moment   

we know how feelings are - experience taking. match own emotions with fictional characters. experience taking is harder in front of mirror so it can be related with ego suppress.





#### Emotions
Revarding or Aversive

|Primal Emtion|Affective Feeling|
|--|--|
Seeking | Enthousiastic
Rage | Pissed-off
Fear | Anxious
Lust | Horny
Care | Tender & Loving
Panic | Lonley & Sad
Play | Joyous


## Agency
the abstract principle that autonomous beings, agents, are capable of acting by themselves; see autonomy  
From a game design perspective, Player Agency is the player's ability to impact the story through the game design or gameplay1

create problem not puzzle - agency


####

1. Quality
 - Active presence - expressing agency and will taking actions and locomotive. Extorting will into expression - video games
 - Mental & Social -  communicationg with abstraction of language -literature, podcasting, consuming information, internet
 - Embodied & Environmental - cinematic storyteling of film, music lighting rythm (fiulm, build and release narrative tension) give sense of time  - music
 - Emotional - site touch smell, haptics. we are trying to digitalize those inputs - theather architecture (VR)
2. Context
3. Character
4. Story


base of life: substance or dynamics of processes  

Outward Inward / Individual Bonding

People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.


##  Presence  
- teleport body   


## Immersion  
- teleport mind   
deep mental involvement

Immerse : altered time. fully `immersed` with mechanics while challenge and tension in balance  (anxiety vs boredom)

spatial (envo), genual sence of space







## Entertainment
- Entertainment is an escape from problems

things happening > its excitement its entertainment



## Engagement  
- Engagement involves solving problems

mental or manual effort meets interactivity  (not in books)

Psychological presence. According to his definition, engagement refers to the state in which individuals express their entire self



###  Flow  
`Flow` state / the `Zone`
`Game Follow` - is wave zone between anxiety and boredom (sometimes challenge and sometimes powerful)  
- `Difficulty Curve` - Challenge  
- `Pacing` Rhythm + Pressure >Manage stress. If there is no stress its not meaningful and you don't care. So pressure is good  
- `Learning Curve` - Onboarding > tutorials super important   


Challenges vs Abilities


|Challenges/Abilities |Low  || High  |
|--|--|--|--|
High |Anxiety (stressed, Alert) | Arousal (Alert Focused) | Flow (Focused, Happy)
 | | Worry (Sad, Stressed) || Control (Happy, Confident)
Low | Apathy (Sad, Depressed) |Boredom (Depressed, Contented)|Relaxation (Confident, Contented)





- primal forces
- context depended
- expose things to promote them
- predictable

if you lost a momentum from one moment to next and persist in that state


involvement, commitment, passion,
enthusiasm, absorption, focused effort, zeal, dedication, and energy.

# Structure



[Game Design](/gamedesign/)   
[Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)   
[Game Theory](/gametheory/)   


Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.






#### Cycles

**Second to second**     
**Minute to minute**     
**Hour to Hour**  

- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change


#### Endgame

.



Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.
