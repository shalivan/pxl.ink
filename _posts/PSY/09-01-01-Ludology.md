Narrative Experience


# Medium
Every medium have it own narrations styles, varying on genres and format (series, shorts...). Linear narrative is not enough for games. See or listen not as powerful as play themselves.
Games and stories share a lot in common but Narratology in games can be not as important.

# Genres

# Storytelling in games


## Explicit Narration
Cutscenes text written narrator    





In literature: An explicit narrator is a narrator or character in a story that is the one telling the story. First person narrators are by definition explicit narrators.


##  Implied Narration
Implicit

An implied narrative arises from visual cues that create the barest impression of a story in the minds of viewers. It is the act of withholding the whole story, rather than the attempt to visually illustrate the story, that defines these images

player must figure out itself   
implicit refers to something that is suggested or implied but not ever clearly said.

a reliable character telling their own story, a character telling another character's story, and an unreliable character telling the story.

Mistrust and misdirection  oftren are good narative tools    

##  Emergent Narration
Emerge from system     
Mechanics in narration - implement plot in mechanics  

###  Narrative vs Mechanics Driven
How much power over the world

**Game story domination**  -   
**Player story domination** -   


mechanick video storytell:
- Edit finth, fish gameplay
- Half Life2, can to trash tutorial


### Ludo narrative Harmony
- Action fit settings to achieve harmony relation between narration and gameplay
premise and setting of story make sense with actions you perform
- It only appear when player can interact with world in meaningful for a story way. feel game through the gameplay
how themes are communicated through the gameplay

##  Environmental Narration


## Experience
Experience as an end itself


### Paradox of control
key element of enjoyment
how to offer meaningful choice  without offering full control.

## Games structure

Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.





#### Cycles

**Second to second**     
**Minute to minute**     
**Hour to Hour**  

- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change


#### Endgame

.



Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.

```
# Structure Elements



- Coincidence are bad in story
- Show a little details that can paint a grander picture.
- **Strange attractor** new spin on familiar idea or 2 ideas
- **Seeding** Spreading tiny bits of exposition
- **Payoff** Response   
- **Foreshadowing** Plant idea ahead and earlier to connect later  

## Scope
To much stories in witch the fate of the world was at stake
Bigger stakes not equal more powerful stories


## Exposition

- Explanation is not as fun as phenomena itself.

### Exposition Scene in cinema

- Create a desire to know by arousing curiosity. With hunger for information even most complicated set of dramatized facts will pass smoothly into understanding.
- Dave the best for last
- Deliver surprises based on established rules
[Story by: Robert McKee]

Dialog or action - which move plot forward
Scenes  włozone dla wyjasnienie jak jest plot hole
exposition by narration  ??

### Show and Tell in writing

**Showing** dramatizes - emotions opinions sensations. deeper and details to feel more connecting to experience      
**Telling** summarize -  “Talk is cheap.” Actions speak louder than words    
[Craft of Fiction by: Perry Tubbock]

As long as it character think its ok, if it sounds like author butting into explain things you've probably fallen into telling [Understanding Show, Don't Tell by: Janice Hardy]     


Stronger showing:
- Don't show monster but causes it makes u scared
- Avoid opinion related adjectives like:  beautiful
- use evidence for claims and let them go to conclusion You want to make. 2+2
- emotions are complex concept and must be demonstrated with concrete details.  showing with details
