# Classical Approach



Books imagine, movie see, games act.
Oral Stories > Theater > Books > Film > Radio > TV > Games > AR

- Jean Piaget (9 August 1896 – 16 September 1980) was a Swiss psychologist Importance of games:
- Johan Huizinga: Nature & Significance of Play as a Cultural Phenomenon [pdf](https://nideffer.net/classes/270-08/week_01_intro/Huizinga.pdf)
- Someone who wants something badly (OBJECTIVE) and is having a hard time getting it. (OBSTACLE).


# Ludology

**Ludology** (etymologically 'game logic') - Study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a field of cultural studies that deals with all types of games throughout history. Every medium has its own narration styles, varying on genres, format, framing of art and limitations. Linear narrative is not enough for games and can be less important. Movies can create 'knowledge differences' easier than games which blend protagonist and player.  Plot and characters are things VG find verry difficult to deal. In linear movies we say: **show don't tell**, in interactive entertainment it convert to **play**, **do don't show**. But we should use every method in hierarchy just in good proportions.
(sometimes is quicker, cheaper and more efficient to tell).


| Paradigm Characteristics |  [Narratology](/narratology/) |Ludology|
|---|---|---|
|Community structures | Mostly pedagogy, limited number of non-pedagogy researchers | Non-pedagogical game studies, although some thematic overlap with pedagogy
|Group commitment networks |Wide range of disciplines, including drama & literature, education, cognition, management | Narrow range of allegiances, limited to non-pedagogy - one central research center, one peer-reviewed journal, and between one and two dozen primary investigators
|Shared examples | Computer simulation, non computer simulation, role play, experiential learning, drama, literature, film | Videogame, virtual reality, hypertext, television, and emergent forms of computer play
|Tacit knowledge and intuition | Pedagogical side of experience - i.e., learning and cognition | Non-pedagogical side of experience - i.e., play
| | Cyclical nature | Linear Nature

|   |  |  
|---|---|
| Incommensurability | Inconclusive - depends on investigator's stance regarding reductionism and holistic thinking

See or listen not as powerful as play themselves:
- Games as `Rules` + `fictional Content`
- Free movement and actions, Need to act.` Engage with external`
- `Reactivity` Respond to your actions


# Authorship

**Narrative** (story meaning) vs **Mechanics** (dynamical meaning). Driven How much power over the world. (Authored vs generative narration)
(linear) `Linear` > `Wide Linear` (linear with paths) > `Interactive Linear` >  `Multi ending` >  `Branching path` (multi choice but not emergent) > `Open World` > `Open ended`  >  `Emergent` > `Sand box` (Fully player driven) > (cyclical) > `Random`

**Game story domination**  -   Authored - no impact on story - Linear  - low agency hi certainty of deliver    
**Player story domination** -  Generative - agency & expression of will - Cyclical  - high agency, low certainty

## Agency

It's about degree of control and influence a player has over the game world and its narrative. It's about the choices and actions a player can take within the confines of the game.
(player's ability to impact the story through the game design or gameplay)

##  Autonomy

It's about the player's ability to decide how they want to engage with the game, even if the choices are limited.
the abstract principle that autonomous beings, agents, are capable of acting by themselves.
- freedom is not control: Between freedom and controlis a subltle ideology though, one that transcends ther mere confines of the game and extends into reality. -


## ?

- is player forced like with cutscene but can join narrative lore when he want    
- create problem not puzzle   

1. Quality
 - `Active presence` - expressing agency and will taking actions and locomotive. Extorting will into expression - video games
 - `Mental & Social` -  communication with abstraction of language -literature, podcasting, consuming information, internet
 - `Embodied & Environmental` - cinematic storytelling of film, music lighting rhythm (film, build and release narrative tension) give sense of time  - music
 - `Emotional` - site touch smell, haptics. we are trying to digitalize those inputs - theater architecture (VR)
2. Context
3. Character
4. Story

Outward Inward / Individual Bonding

Feeling being in control.

1. what to communicate
2. what emotions

# Narration
Some game structures can be metaphors
Narration can be Atmospheric or Narrative

Avoid Red Herring (something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important question)

## Embedded / Explicit
Embedded narratives are pre-determined stories, defined by author. The game creators decide the narrative and the player follows their direction.
player can’t influence  backstory.

**Text written narrator**. explicit things are explained.  (cutscenes). In literature: An explicit narrator is a narrator or character in a story that is the one telling the story.


- text tani
    - nie długie .ilość tekstu jaką jestem w stanie przeczytać zależy głównie od tempa rozgrywki.
   - znajdzki i notki na UI przy przedmiotach
   - zaszyfrowane: alien graffiti". Komputer pokładowy próbuje dla nas rozszyfrować ich treść. Im więcej znajdziemy tzw. cipher-ów, tym lepiej komputer radzi sobie z tekstem. Tutaj przykładowy xenoglyph,-daje nam drobne hinty co do tragicznej przeszłości Seleny.
-  audio >taśmy z nagraniami )czy przyklejamy do gracza_
- voicover
- narrator (ghost / astra )
- cutscany  najdrozsze

.
- choices can be also explicit like: rpg dialog chose or harvesting little sister

### Narrator
- First person narrators are by definition explicit narrators.
- Silent protagonist - to feel easy to slip in his role . (silence and concient is like agree)
add to agency

```
#### part of story
Diegesis (/ˌdaɪəˈdʒiːsɪs/; from the Greek διήγησις from διηγεῖσθαι, "to narrate") is a style of fiction storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:

Details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative.
The story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.[1]
There is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.

#### part of stoyteling
 non-diegetic elements which are stylistic elements of how the narrator tells the story ("part of the storytelling").


####  Mimesis:
- The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, which opens with a comparison between the way the world is represented in Homer's Odyssey and the way it appears in the Bible


Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the dithyramb is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in epic poetry. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".[3] In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as him or herself.[4]

In gmaes, mostly UI:
 "extra-diegetic"; a game character does not know about them even though for the player they may present crucial information
 non-diagetic sounds; voiceover  sfx theme songs

 ```


## Evocative Narrative /  Enviromental Storyteling
Implicitly construcred by the player
Implied - Suggested but not directly expressed. Arises **from visual cues** or stmbols that create the barest impression of a story in the minds of viewers. It is the act of withholding the whole story, rather than the attempt to visually illustrate the story, that defines these images. player must figure out itself

Most immersive type of narration ! - it s the world speak and player will find their own story  

mimesis
connotations – the memories

- comenting of your actions in past
- too subtle invisible choices can feel like linear game


callbacks - (can be punchline later) - remained the known


### Spatial storytelling
Narrative spaces / Environmental storytelling
How ideas, mood, and story are expressed through visual form

[Level Design](/leveldesign/)  / Scene / stage design / [Lore](/lore/)

Required deductive resoning, - connect details to create story. Investigative and archeological skils.
 - (piano in the kitchen > hole > music room upstairs)


## Emergent Narrative.
Emergent - make own story  with tools we get (author rules), but not direct writer expression      
Mechanics in narration - implement plot in mechanics  


### Enacted
Enacted narratives rely on players developing their characters. Story elements such as power-upgrades and levelling up use enacted narratives. These narratives are usually in single-player games that emphasise character growth.

### Emerge from systems
Need building blocks    
- resonant theme - as universal as practical if desired for sharing
- meshes narratively with existing mechanics - test against sample story or patch existing holes
- mechanics < support > presentation
- involves user in state

(Roguelikes, Sandboxes, Minecraft's, Dwarf Fortress)

### Procedural storytelling
Procedural Narrative Generation:

Prioritizes agent spontaneity (all improvisation and simulation ) (Dwarf Fortress) <> Prioritize authorial structure (Adventures )
- simulation centric approach  
- plot centric approach  

[link a](https://ubm-twvideo01.s3.amazonaws.com/o1/vault/gdc2018/presentations/Mateas_Michael_Teaching_Procedural_Storytelling.pdf)  [link b](https://books.google.pl/books/about/Procedural_Storytelling_in_Game_Design.html?id=4RamDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)  


!!! procedural shatter in story: - hadncrafted but procedural hard to control pace of narrative bits. (embrace it) > few things in linear fashion
 i dont know what it mean >>> but then next time u see you will renew knowledge about it and sonnection apears.

## No narration

#### Experience as an end itself
or devolved from mechanics:
- elementy multi - mosty / listy notki z miejsc / smierci
#### Randomness
- (pre luck) input (before player make decision): levels
- (post luck) output  (after action, hit chances in x com, lutbox) (more anger and res not for competence but bad luck undercuts strategy )

## Player 


 We overcome obstacles by taking actions. Those actions define the character.  What they do to get what they want. characterization - external description, shell, to see what character is need to look beyond characterization and see what he want.
- Who make a choice what player does. (in linear is designer in open world is player )


Character types: (who chose a characterization)
- Silent - negative space where player can fill.
- Cinematic - designer
- Open  - player

[GDC Strong video game character](https://youtu.be/4mgK2hL33Vw)

High level wants by designer
Low level wants by player (how i go to high level quest)


High level wants by player: no character like Minecraft


what they WANT (PURPOSE) (if no purpose noone care) if same purpose you can be not same as character
whaty they DO (ACTION) - do action match with character ?
how they SEEM (TRAIT) - not important

# Experience


Alfred North Whitehead (known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as process philosophy) reality is experience.   

## Psych states

### Presence  
`Teleport body` into a space. Spatial Presence   
### Immerse  
`Teleport mind` - deep mental involvement. Immerse : altered time, with general sense of space (spatial)
Fully `immersed` with mechanics while `challenge` and `tension` in balance  (`anxiety` vs `boredom`)

The difference between immersive experience and traditional is the presence of a viewing port, proscenium or a frame with which to take in the experience. - Sara Thacher
### Engagement  
Manual or mental `effort meets interactivity` (involves solving problems) (not in books)   
Psychological presence. According to his definition, engagement refers to the state in which individuals express their entire self

----

##  Illusion

People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

### Virtual vs real experience

- people are able to belief in fake
- real world experience have additional fidelity



### Suspension of Disbelief
- accepting unrealistic situations
- audience scram on movies
- Rules of game established reality that become a game norm
- Suspension of disbelief is necessary only when we failed to create secondary belief.
- inconsistence can break immersion


### Paradox of control
key element of enjoyment
how to offer meaningful choice  without offering full control.


### Illusion
Only when authentic (coherent and consistent )

Belief - Fiction is not real    
Alife - Suspend true believe for a moment   

we know how feelings are - experience taking. match own emotions with fictional characters. experience taking is harder in front of mirror so it can be related with ego suppress.


------

### Entertainment / Enjoyment
- Entertainment is an escape from problems

things happening > its excitement its entertainment


###  Flow  
`Flow` state / the `Zone`
`Game Follow` - is wave zone between anxiety and boredom (sometimes challenge and sometimes powerful)  
- `Difficulty Curve` - Challenge  
- `Pacing` Rhythm + Pressure >Manage stress. If there is no stress its not meaningful and you don't care. So pressure is good  
- `Learning Curve` - Onboarding > tutorials super important   


Challenges vs Abilities


|Challenges/Abilities |Low  | | High  |
|--|--|--|--|
|High |Anxiety (stressed, Alert) | Arousal (Alert Focused) | Flow (Focused, Happy)
 | | Worry (Sad, Stressed) || Control (Happy, Confident)
|Low | Apathy (Sad, Depressed) |Boredom (Depressed, Contented)|Relaxation (Confident, Contented)





- primal forces
- context depended
- expose things to promote them
- predictable

if you lost a momentum from one moment to next and persist in that state


involvement, commitment, passion,
enthusiasm, absorption, focused effort, zeal, dedication, and energy.



### Emotions
Regarding or Aversive

|Primal Emtion|Affective Feeling|
|--|--|
|Seeking | Enthousiastic
|Rage | Pissed-off
|Fear | Anxious
|Lust | Horny
|Care | Tender & Loving
|Panic | Lonley & Sad
|Play | Joyous

# Ludo narrative

Harmony & Dissonance
- Action fit settings to achieve harmony relation between narration and gameplay
premise and setting of story make sense with actions you perform
- It only appear when player can interact with world in meaningful for a story way. feel game through the gameplay
how themes are communicated through the gameplay


[YT - Meaningful Mechanics](https://youtu.be/KkdPxZbUNSw)  
mechanics follow narration :
restricted movement - is narration
cyclical nature  


**Connect controls/mechnic with feelings**




[Motivation](/motivation/)



## MDA framework
Game designers will establish the rules and boundaries of a game (`Mechanics`) to create a certain sort of playing environment (`Dynamics`) which will invoke certain feelings, such as fun or thrill, in the player (`Aesthetics`).

|Mechanics|Dynamics|Aesthetic|
|--|--|--|
|Strategic | Systemic | Narrative
|Rules | System | Fun

## EMOTIONAL DESIGN 

>Dawn normal UX pionier - emiotional design 

help form attachments > and how them can help : Emotional design  
help form attachment 
- **visceral** - reaction to stimulus - viceral recations can be inpredicatble - very prersonal on context // and transielnt (short lived). Important for making first impressions 
- **behavioral** - can influence your beh 
- **reflecticve** - will i reflect on it later. 

Games systems can create feedback loop and can respond to beh and emot changes ./

Resonate !
Bonding vs	Bridging



Fun enable easy learning   



Exposition is ok in games sometimes  - (moving story forward plot device - shity - dressed up exposition )
- `Repetition` to highlight importance !  -
- `Dissonant Juxtaposition `- przeciwstawne rzeczy naprzeciw siebie (things side buy side creat context between them 0 if context is contradictory create mental dissonance audience need to resolve)




## Ending:
- force to reflect
- reconsider theme we starting with.

postcolonial crituique of games ??

social structure & hierarchy & conflict

BEZ STRUCTUR NARRAITVE ALE NARATIONS AND CONNECTIONS:
sport event:
- teams creation
- constatnt buildup
- final climax  
plot the same but story dynamic !!!!!

sports / war - same epic conflicts



who we are
who are people we are rleated to

DRAMA:
- conflict
- comebacks
- underdogs
- social structure > hierarchies
- relationships
- champions heroes&villains
- grudges&revenge

sport seasons as interactive narrative - generate stories, setup conflict.
same plot but every season have different exciting personal stories and drama.
- failure when time move forrward creates drama
- escalation to framatic climax
- neather linera or branching




People solve puzzles because they like pain, and they like being released from pain, and they like most of all that they find within themselves the power to release themselves from their own pain. - Mike Selinker and Thomas Snyder - Puzzle Craft.




# Makeing games


- Game iterative > Greater level of complexity
- You can imagine what it may be like but you never gonna know until you actually experience it. match expectation with embodied experience. > Iterative process.

peer review:  playback > review > action plan.
https://youtu.be/Gsh-aYdFWws?t=1376


iterative: Improve existing game ! ide for succesfull project



which can happen if they don’t ‘announce’ their entry if they spawn from out of sight



important is to: empower player to action
need: choice, motivation, information, time
to use systems


why believe in your story
where u get info about game
who will play game



minimal viable mechanics

oprimize for interactions not ideas
vision is lot of work not just an idea

structure of game
