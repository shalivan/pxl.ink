# Medium
Every medium have it own narrations styles, varying on genres and format. Linear narrative is not enough for games.

- Games as Rules + fictional Content
- Free movement and actions   
- See or listen not as powerful as play themselves
- Need to act. Engage with external   



Games and stories share a lot in common but Narratology in games can be not as important.

|Paradigm Characteristics | Narratology |Ludology
|---|---|---|
Community structures | Mostly pedagogy, limited number of non-pedagogy researchers | Non-pedagogical game studies, although some thematic overlap with pedagogy
Group commitment networks |Wide range of disciplines, including drama & literature, education, cognition, management | Narrow range of allegiances, limited to non-pedagogy - one central research center, one peer-reviewed journal, and between one and two dozen primary investigators
Shared examples | Computer simulation, noncomputer simulation, role play, experiential learning, drama, literature, film | Videogame, virtual reality, hypertext, television, and emergent forms of computer play
Tacit knowledge and intuition | Pedagogical side of experience - i.e., learning and cognition | Non-pedagogical side of experience - i.e., play

| Incommensurability | Inconclusive - depends on investigator's stance regarding reductionism and holistic thinking

# Narration


## Explicit
Cutscenes text written narrator    





In literature: An explicit narrator is a narrator or character in a story that is the one telling the story. First person narrators are by definition explicit narrators.


##  Implied
Implicit

An implied narrative arises from visual cues that create the barest impression of a story in the minds of viewers. It is the act of withholding the whole story, rather than the attempt to visually illustrate the story, that defines these images

player must figure out itself   
implicit refers to something that is suggested or implied but not ever clearly said.

a reliable character telling their own story, a character telling another character's story, and an unreliable character telling the story.

Mistrust and misdirection  oftren are good narative tools    

##  Emergent
Emerge from system     
Mechanics in narration - implement plot in mechanics  

###  Narrative vs Mechanics Driven
How much power over the world

**Game story domination**  -   
**Player story domination** -   


mechanick video storytell:
- Edit finth, fish gameplay
- Half Life2, can to trash tutorial


### Ludo narrative Harmony
- Action fit settings to achieve harmony relation between narration and gameplay
premise and setting of story make sense with actions you perform
- It only appear when player can interact with world in meaningful for a story way. feel game through the gameplay
how themes are communicated through the gameplay




### Procedural storytelling

# Experience
Experience as an end itself


### Paradox of control
key element of enjoyment
how to offer meaningful choice  without offering full control.

# Structure



[Game Design](/gamedesign/)  
[Game Mechanics](/gamemechanics/)  



Mechanics should be part of narration - We've now gone from just having a really simplistic puzzle about opening a door to an entire story experience.





#### Cycles

**Second to second**     
**Minute to minute**     
**Hour to Hour**  

- Story Shape Ups and downs tension !!!!
- Therefor instead of: Then  (a means to an end)  (Causality)
- Try and fail. Fail and find  new: clue, inspiration, information
   plot expansion: instead of twist /u get more than promised not unexpected change  
   change


#### Endgame

.



Mental Modeling. Sense of mental image of game. that we would like to get.
