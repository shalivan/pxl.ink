How those things influence us (WHAT BEHAVIOUR IS)
figure out  action pattern behind behavior

- what behavior is. Consider fixed action patterns:
- 1 millisecond before what was going on in brains (what parts and neurotransmitters)
- 1 min what was in environment that triggered
- what was releasing stimulus
- 1 day what hormones that day. sensitizing to enviro stimulus
- parental behavior, early development
- what's genetic of individual
- genetic of species
- 1 million year before

# Human Sexual Behavior

`libido` - hornienes   
`attractivity` - how attractive  
`receptivity`   
`proceptivity` - behavior to create receptive effect in others    

`motivation` is different than `performance` - dichotomy    


- monkeys and apes have orgasm too
- lordosis behavior, also known as mammalian lordosis reflex
- non reproductive sex, dolphins and some apes but mostly humans
- foreplay not only humans
- homosexuality's not only humans
- egalitarian sex - in animals sometimes there are groups that can and cannot
- humans - conducted in private
- masturbation in other species too  
- marriage - lot of human cultures poly but most people been in polygamic relations


10 40% children in western culture not raised by biological parents   
relation ship - 4 years marriage HUMANS: SERIAL MONOGAMISTS   
cheating  
romance - new invention   


dopamine neurobiology of  anticipation! (also pleasure, reward)  (loss of proseptive libido > depresion > lost of sex interest)
dopamine activeate when atractive person is lookingng at you,
when unatractive look away (not at you) dopamine also activate.


back to base line post orgasm -  symphatetic nervous system recovery time  (slower in femalees)

fix action but regard to spiecie. different have different
releasing stimulas, are also different

attractivity
proseptivity
resiptivity - how rwceptive to interestt to othjer indiv

most culture poligamist but major part monogamy inside .
marriage - most cultures have
dopamine in sex imortatnt > libido proseptivity (mezo limbic dopamine sys) bo sa tez inne


- im so cool cocaine
- maby: far more 50% 50 % chances - dopamine turbo up MAX  
- 75% 25%  

oxitrocine - hormon  rozpylic przed reklamÄ… zebny ludzie uwiezyli w twoj przekaz - neuro marketing
oxitocine mimo wszystko w wiekszosci w organizmie odpowiada za cos innego   
# Aggression
# Chaos & Reductionism
# Emergence & Complexity
# Language
# Shizophrenia

# Sex

bioloiogical dif :

- stronger
- faster
- biger bones
- shape hip
- oxygen capacity
- xx men, xy chromosom
- diferent in interest: females peace, males justice
consider you sex from ideological standpoint






# Hormones


Amino acid-derived hormones  
Eicosanoid  
Peptide  
Steroid  
synchro cycles menstrual  

### Testosteron
- amplifie agression patern if there are (not agression  but keep status so in humand can be in economics
oxitocin - exaturate line between us and them  like [pro social somehow for us ??]

anabolic steroids  - testosteron hjormon to build muscles sth with violence



### Serotonin
- Obsession and compulsions
(depresion)

- SSRI / SNRI (inhibit reuptake serot) (postraumatic., or obsesive compulsive ) take long , if to much:  insomnia irretability erectal disfunct.  hadek and sleep disturbs odstawianie

- mood  (banana, sun and physic excercises) food fruets and vegies
change lifestyle

### Dopamine
Anxiety & attention
(depresion)

dopamine - pleasure - cocaine  anticipation for reward. motivation to do whats needed
if you change probablility from 100% its go up to roof like crazy uncertanity of 'maby'  - las vegas  uncertanity in system

The **mesolimbic pathway**, sometimes referred to as the reward pathway, is a dopaminergic pathway in the brain.

### Norepinephrine
atention, Motivation, Pleasure
(depresion)

##### Stress cascade:
>Anexity: Cortisole Adrenaline Rush released physiological effect even if its simulation and not real effect (horror movie, skydiving because endorfines are released too)
