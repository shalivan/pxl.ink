## Game Theroy
>Interaction and payofs. the mathematical study of optimizing agents
- `Cooperative` - how to be fair - coalition and benefit and contribution type in coalition
- `Competitive` - how to be smatr
- `Zero Sum Game` - Interest is not overlaping. `win-lose`




**TicTacToe**   
`Pavlov strategy` - switch if not working (you can exploit)  
`TfT` -  Tit for tat drove other strategies to extinction and formalize optimal strategy  may lose battles but win wars. (
Vulnerable of signal error). Start nice cooperating > forgiving > cooperate when you can   
`FTfT` - forgiving tit for tat  witch is more vulnerable for exploitation TfT -> jezeli zaufanie to switch to forgiven TFTF Trust  
`Madness` - possibility of changes   
Strategies to survive forgiving tic for tat (vulnerable to exploit) > forgiven tic for tat after while  

**Poisoner dilemma**

Very complicated not always everything plays around these lines. (some Exceptions)   
multiple goals, number of rounds....  In lot of species there is no cognitive strategy  

**Nash equilibrium**
(rational play when more then one player. not only define start but always believes)
 is a concept within game theory where the optimal outcome of a game is where there is no incentive to deviate from their initial strategy.

depth limited search for imperfect information games. (nie wszystko na raz)

**zero sum game**

**two player vs more**

**perfect information/imp**
