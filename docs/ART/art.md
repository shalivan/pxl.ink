# **ART**



# HowTo

- Understand medium
- Don't save on hardware


# Cognition

- **Don't make excuses**.   
- **Practice**
- **Perseverance**. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success)
- **Habits** help to free mind of thinking about basics. Rhythm have benefits
- **Control attention span**. State of Mind. Breaths. Get into the zone.

# Planning  

   - **Identify** possible `obstacles` that can interrupt and `constraints` that can slow you down.
   - Check `anchors` to work within restrictions.
   - Use **limitations as strength**
   - Work on main issues and resolve **core problems**.  
   - Break **complex problems**: into pieces
   - **Pipelines**: to make data and information flow through easy
   - Make it **simple** (simple rule > complicated behavior)
   - Have **crumple zone** to be able to reduce scope
   - planing is about **time** vs detail
   - Automation > proceduralism
   - **RnD** - Set `end goal`, gather `references`, build `prototype`, iterations `refine`  


   Detail precision and nuance creates fidelity   
   Iterations  

- Difficulty of subject matter: easy: give you large margin of error - organic shapes, subject matters we are not familiar on daily basis, more things are more sophisticated so medieval are easier and manufactured harder, human is hard > faces + dynamics and motion
- Road to first pixel / check your effect asap  to

# Concept
  Concept is communication form.

- Exploration: **variations** and **iterations** (make 3 options and hybridize  based on feedback)
- Concept should be usable
- Form perspective to be **able to translate** directly to 3d
- Draw additional **site views** and important elements.
- Don't limit yourself. Use 3d, textures, kit bash, references, photo bash
- **form** and **function**

 |  |  **Movement** | Lines, edge, color or path that imply **Direction** (flying birds, road)
 |  |  **Repetition** | Similar elements in **Sequence**. Create **Rhythm** or **Pattern**. **Pacing**
 |  |  **Unity** | all elements together create **Harmony**
 |  |  **Variety** | hold viewer attention

# UX/UI

- Consistency / Intentionallyty
- Ergonomy. The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- Visual Feedback
- Simplicity / Cognitive Load. (The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.)

**UI types**:
- non-Diagetic,
- Diagetic,
- Spatial,
- Meta

# Architecture

Arch as response to anchors:  needs / function / context / local constrain /  external conditions  (sun: south wall is most efficient, land features)









# Form
Point of contact between mass and space

- forms, (space, structure) , outward expression. (size scale texture ) emotions (formal language create forms)
- shapes (l- shelter and open , long sides... )

|--|--|
![](/Sources/Arch/add.png)  | Additive | picturesque, full of movement,
![](/Sources/Arch/sub.png)  |Subtractive   | generous, When regular form mising volume peart but retain identity




#### Imposible Figure

# Space
 Space is formed by relationship to object within. Literal space define scene by Degree of enclosure.

 |  |  |Enclosure Spaces|
 |--|--| --|
 ![](/Sources/Arch/floor.png) | Floor | topology / architecture Man made / natural, Unmodulated / Modulated, Ground stability, Balcony
 ![](/Sources/Arch/columns.png) |Columns | Obelisk, Column (europeans order), Pier, Pilaster. (Rhythm > directionality) (forming subspaces, fasades)

#### Implied  Space

| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/Sources/Arch/implied2.png) |Implied|When elements or spaces are not explicit but are nonetheless apparent. Perspective in 2d is implied

- implied by shadow (shadow space )
- half-roofing
- platform Schodki (sugerowana),
- open colonnade   

#### Negative Space


| | ||
|--|--|--|
![](/Sources/Arch/court.png) |Negative | Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s)




- court
- horizon height- separation and connections



## Spatial Form

##### Organization
is both the physical and material solid-stuff of the built environment and its void-space. It is meant to capture the relationship between solid form and void-form

- **Plane Layout** - indoor, outdoor, connection
- **Pace** - change frequency over time by density over sopace (close spaceing make illusion of fast movement) Repetiton and Rythm

# Composition

- Rule of 3rd  
- `sectio aurea` a+b/a = 1.618 φ  - golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ  
- Edges Can be  `Hard`, `Soft`, `Lost`
- Edge Avoid:   (tangents) `Hidden`, `Skimmed`, `Fused`, `Stolen`
- `Edges` change in `Object`, `Plane` or `Color`  
- Depth
- Focal point, composition lines (but its not true that they lead eye (physically) its not literally its only specializing abstract concept )
- Cropped things: can be indicated by shadow, character can bye cropped by item

Harmony and disonance - duality

# Draw

## Sketch
- Refer to `human scale` and `relations` with other objects    
- `proportion`, `shape recognition`, `perspective`  

- practice one line not multiple in same place

  line drawings






## Paint   
  - Value !!
  - Biggest to smallest details
  - Detail Control: Most details on: Focal point / silhouettes
  - Stylization  
    - [Flip  for perspective correction]   
    - [Thumbnails for detail correction]    
    - [B&W for valor correction]    

- dynamism / >!>!>>!>!!??!?!
- moment (just before action / during / after )


---

# Color
   - `The Opponent-Process Theory`, `Trichromatic Theory`  
   - Color temperature  vs  neutral colors (W&B and gray)   
   - Work in `HSV` to manage `Chroma` and `Valor` .   

**HSV**   
- Hue - perceived colors. dependent on its dominant wavelength and independent of intensity or lightness.
- Saturation (Chroma) - the strength or dominance of the hue.  
- Lightness (Valor) -  or darkness of the hue.

**Compose Colors**

   || |
   |-|- |
   `Monochrome` | 1 color
   `Analogous`| Similar
   `Complimentary` | Opposites
   `Split-Complementary` | (dominant & support + accent),
   `Triad`  |3 |
   `Tetradic` | 4   


#### Contrast   
- `Value` high key painting has a `high-value` scale (light) vs `low-value` scale (dark).  
- `Hue/Saturation`  
- `Edge`  
- `Proximity`  
- `Texture` (material), `Shape`

# Patterns
### Fractals

    ---



## Character
   - layers: `skeletal`, `muscle`, `fat`, `skin`  
   - proportions  
   - character  

face, eyes, hads,

#### Paint Skin
   - `sun damage`, `blue veins face / forehead`, `petechiae / freckles`, `wrinkles / ance`  




---


## Sculpt Model
   - `silhouettes` > `Medium Frequencies` > `Detail`      
   - Varies details placement.     
   - Sculpt across the form (not with the flow).    
   - Don't use smooth.       
   - Directionality  
   - Maintain Volume

#### Geometry
   - Procedural hard surface: crees
   - Procedural organic: Build geo from curves and points. use procedural for detail (VDB)  

#### Low poly:
   - High fidelity in silhouette defining places

#### Uv's:
   - Consistent texel
   - Orient uv - for brushing, directional mask
   - Bake per part /material ID / separate parts with alphas  

---

## Props
  - elements should be `grounded` in scene  
  - barnackling ssmall things around,
 - footing - awarenes of  intersecting,
 - greebling materialing



## Scene Setup   
   - `Sky box` > `Exp fog` > `Sky Light` > `Directional Light` > `Secondary lights` > `Cam Post` > `Color Grading`
 - `Depth`  - Atmosphere, Repeating same elements in space
- `Light` - but we not evolve to going directly to light

 ----



## Riging
   - `namespaces`  


## Animation
   - `Keyframe`, `reactive`, `dynamic` simulations, `mocap data`
   - Timing FPS
   - Easing curves  
   - Reaction time 0.2 for see 0.1 for hear and less for touch (go / no go time decision)


   ---


## Simulation & procedural   
   - Normalize - Fit parameters to 0-1  

#### Cloths
   - Tailoring (amount of material)   
   - Material properties >  (stretch, bend, weight)    
   - Grain of fabric. (weakness of cross cuts)  



#### Light
   - Unmotivated Light - Support light that doesn't have a physical representation.  
   - `Direct`: `Key light`, `Fill light`, `Rim light`,   `Diffuse light`
   -`Indirect`: `Ambient`, `Bounced`  
   - one eye must be stronger


   ---


### Cinematography
https://chrisbrejon.com/cg-cinematography/appendix-1-guerilla-render-in-production/

#### Camera  
   - Depth, Framing, Cropping, FOV
   - Avoid unnecessary moves, unwanted obj cutouts.   
   - `Depth of Field` `Grain` `Bloom`



#### Editing
   - J cut - sound precedes the cut  - smooth scene introduction
   - B-Roll - video footage that sets the scene, reveals details, or generally enhances the story
   - Eye Trace - being aware of where the audience's eyes are looking
   - 180 axes of action indicate on the screen
   - 45 Degrees at least when 2 cuts showing same obj
   - It’s easy to cut between close and wide angles
   - Cut on Motion / Cut on Similar Elements



   # TRAILKER :: (przeniesc do PR )

   - visual feadback  (hjow easy is to see change and understand)
   - camera distance
   - number of objects
   - audience familiarity with subject. or required knowledge
   more filmmakeing than gameplaying .
   Direction / cammera / puppeetieer
   - you can eye trace for shot cuts: u dont have to move your ewyes to much
   - are u capture as player or 3rd person
   - movement can be character
   - speed of camera tells a lot  character
   - controllers are best for slow movements
   - use metronome when playing to the music
   - intentionality of shots

   - use not only
   Composition
   Redability
   Preformancve



#### Procedurals
>procedural ;
- scalability
- prone to human error

- tiles (procedurally generate world)
- L-system
- tracery and templating text (combining text)
- distribution (hierarchy and clustering and maintain spacing)
- parametric ()
- interpretive: noise Perlin, grid/cell (voronoi/delaunay), metaballs
